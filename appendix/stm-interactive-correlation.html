This was driven home to me a few years ago when I wanted to change jobs. Until I went, I had never been turned down for a job I would interviewed for. I mean that literally. Since I got my degree, I had never been turned down after interviewing for a job. Sometimes I had several offers once but I had never been turned down. discrimination I faced after I went came as quite a shock to me. I could not believe the most people paid, more attention to my disability than my resume. One woman outright refused to interview me because she did not believe I could use a computer all. And that was for a job that was, frankly, beneath me. Of course, I just passed that woman off as an idiot. But if I had really needed that job, that would have hurt. In my opinion, this lack empathy those us who have made it show toward those who have not is a huge problem. I think it greatly undermines our ability to get anything done. opinion is that those us who have made it are obligated to try to make it easier for the next guy. After all, oour paths were smoothed those who came before us. I can show you messages where I have criticized kenneth tremendously. I have huge problems with a lot things he said did.

Your project sounds wonderful with the board! I also appreciate, very much, your insight into fiber through the centuries What inspired me was the myth Ariadne the Minatour Greek Mythology. I thought that story as I was working my own projects with a slender needle my hand, as it flowed, out, passing through the fabrics the objects beads that I work with. I had been a painter before my sight loss 6 1 / 2 years ago - then, I began doing very intricate bead working as well as pottery. And, I began to realize I was still doing paintings, but that my tools had been trhnsformed into needles, threads precious objects! It was quite a revelation to me - I was overwhelmed when I realized that - the connection that women have with thread needles - I thought the harlot the who saved herself her family when she hung a scarlet ribbon or cord from her window to let the warriors know her home was protected so that they were not kileed when the invasion began. Now, I will be working to unearth other such stories where a person received guidance, salvation, safety, revelation because a thread. If anyone has other stories or examples to share with me, that would be excellent. I will check out the ones has noted - people I had not even thought before - thanks so much. work I do is encrusted bead work - done layer upon layer stones, gems, found objects, crystals, beads, etc. pieces are made into Talismans, into wall pieces. I have a tailor who does the construction my many pieces once I have finished my work them - she is excellent a perfectionist so the works are glorious the gallery museum walls. I will attach a couple photos from the Vision Revision show that is now up Gallery, PA for those who may be able to see them through technology. work is all clearly done from a female perspective, using materials that were traditionally \" women's work. \" themes are based myth icons."],"thought_2":[", Yes, I heard the man who paints. I just do not see the point doing that I can not enjoy myself, that many the people around me ( fellow Federationists such ) can not enjoy. As for the man who illuminated the bible, yes I heard him. Before I lost my sight, I did look the pictures the that he did, it was amazing. What I did could not compare with that kind work. What I did was mostly commissioned scrolls for members the Society for Creative Anachronism, a medieval recreation group. I did everything from Celtic knotwork to miniature scenes ( one scene, for example, was a marketplace with the main focus a pottery shop... it was for a man whose main business was pottery ). I also painted coats arms did illumionations around calligraphied poetry ( I did not do the calligraphy myself, but had a friend do it, as my calligraphy was horrible ). I still have my portfolio scrolls that I did, along with works I did outside medieval illumination, including prismacoloour ppictures cats, whales, a zebra, other animals.... see a pattern there? I love animals, enjoyed doing prismacolour based them.

There is a print symbol that visually looks like three dots or three decimal points or three periods arranged a horizontal row. correct name for this symbol is ellipsis. This is represented braille a sequence three dot - 3 braille cells. In print it is sometimes represented three separate periods sometimes a single print character which resembles three separate periods close to each other. ellipsis is often used math to show that something has been left out where what has been left out is either obvious from context or unimportant. There is also a mathematical construct known as a recurring or repeating decimal, not decimal point. This refers to a repeated number or number sequence that occurs somewhere after a decimal point repeats indefinitely. Thus the number 5. 4333 the 333 might be a recurring decimal. Print math uses two methods to indicate that the 333 repeats indefinitely. One method is to place an ellipsis after the number. However, the preferred method to indicate the repitition is to place a bar over the number or sequence that repeats. In this example you would write 5. 43 with a bar over the three. In the number 5. 4323232 the 32 might be a recurring decimal. If so, you would write 5. 432 with a single bar over the digits 32. If a single digit repeats indefinitely, it is indicated following it with the dots - 156 cell that represents an over bar. If two or more digits repeat indefinitely, it is indicated using the modifier notation. ( This notation is used for print underscripts overscripts. ) In this case a dot - 5 is placed before the first digit the sequence then a three - cell modifier is placed after the last digit the sequence. first cell the modifier, dots - 126, indicates that the next symbol is an over script. cell, dots - 156, is the horizontal bar. third cell, dots - 12456, is the modification terminator. hope this helps, SusanJ"],"thought_2":["When you? re looking for the average ( arithmetic mean ) a set data, you add up the values divide the number values you have. For example, the mean { 5,, 15, 20, 25 } = ( 5+10+15+20+25 ) / 5=75 75 / 5=15, so the mean over your set data is 15. Another saying this: the average a set data is the total sum the set divided the number values. By extension, the average rate change is the total change the function over the given interval, divided the length the interval. Differentiation gives the instantaneous rate change any point, while integration gives the total change over a range values, which is what we want.

Sorry. One can imagine a home - made system employing an IR heat lamp, which can be purchased for a few dollars. I know that this has been tried various tinkerers, but it has not been made to work, because nobody can figure out how to expose the full page to more or less uniform radiation the correct intensity from a single lamp or even several such lamps. Moreover, one has to be pretty careful not to get some portion the paper too hot - if you do, it catches fire. Some the less expensive swell paper \" toasters \" have had an unfortunate tendency to catch fire. As far as I know, none these are still the market. Commercial swell paper toasters use an IR heat bar wide enough to cover the full width the paper. radiation dose is controlled the speed movement, one finds the right speed trial error. Swell paper is notoriously non - reproducible to manufacture, one often needs a bit trial error for every new batch paper. Maybe modern papers are more uniform than they once were though.
