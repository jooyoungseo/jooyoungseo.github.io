# Autoethnography?

.large[
&gt; "Autobiographical genre of writing and research that displays multiple layers of consciousness, *connecting the personal to the cultural*. Back and forth, autoethnographers gaze, first, through an ethnographic wide-angle lens, focusing outward on social and cultural aspects of their personal experience; then, they look inward, exposing a vulnerable self that is moved by and may move through, refract, and resist cultural interpretations. As they zoom backward and forward, inward and outward, *distinctions between the personal and cultural become blurred*, sometimes beyond recognition."
]

# Procedures

## 1. Community exploration.

## 2. Reflexive Action.

## 3. Integration.

???
this autoethnographic research followed the three reflexive phases over 6 months:

(1) qualitatively explore each online community and take notes about some challenges and tips of the blind makers at the community level; (2) self-experience (as a blind maker myself) with each of the three maker tools without sighted assistance and take notes and audio-record myself to capture any new challenges found within the personal level (action revealed through the communities); and (3) integrate the two types of notes to identify three most common challenges and their possible solutions.

# Three Challenges

---
class: center, middle

# 1. Inaccessible/Undocumented Instructions for Maker Toolkits

## "While blind people could independently develop projects using Arduino, many of the important accessibility steps were undocumented and unknown"

.large[.Large[.Large[.Large[.right[(Miele 2015)]]]]]

???
blind makers’ experiences reveal that even some popular mak- er kits (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry PI, Little Bits, Snap Circuits, Squishy Circuits, etc.) do not provide alternative screen- reader-friendly instructions.

Blind Arduino Project leader and blind maker, Joshua Miele, explained the necessity of initiating an independent

accessible blog for Arduino blind users, stating that while blind people could independently develop projects using Arduino, many of the important accessibility steps were undocumented and unknown^ (Miele 2015). I attempted to find whether the major maker companies, mentioned above, provided any accessible instructions on their websites describing the names, positions, and functions of electronics for visually-impaired makers. Regrettably, Joshua’s remarks remain all too true. None of the major maker companies have created alternative access to the instructions that sighted makers take for granted.

# 2. Less Tangible Design of the Making Board

.large[.large[&gt; "It was hard for me to get started with bread boards due to the small parts" (Perry 2016b)

&gt; "While this is doable, it’s definitely a pain to do every time you need to find a particular pin" (Miele 2016)]]
]

???
The lack of tactile separation between different circuit areas is another challenging design aspect for visually impaired users. Placing an electrical component in the appropriate spot or identifying a section on a board may seem like relatively sim- ple processes for sighted makers, but the same tasks can be intimidating for makers with visual impairments.

breadboard is good because it requirs no sodering

Despite the seamless extensibility of breadboards, their design causes frustration for blind makers because the size of the holes is too small to be identified solely by touch.

Without the use of one’s vision, a probe (e.g., a jumper pin or stylus) must be used to feel along the top of the breadboard, count the board’s tiny holes one by

one, and discover the desired spot to plug in a component.

Ken Perry, the founder of Blind Electronics, shared his personal struggles with breadboards, reporting that Bit was hard for [him] to get started with bread boards do [sic] to the small parts^ (Perry 2016b). Without the use of one’s vision, a probe (e.g., a jumper pin or stylus) must be used to feel along the top of the breadboard, count the board’s tiny holes one by

one, and discover the desired spot to plug in a component. On the Blind Arduino Blog, Josh reflects, BWhile this is doable, it’s definitely a pain to do every time you need to find a

particular pin^ (Miele 2016).
Unfortunately, the header blocks on some Arduino boards are manufactured without gaps between sections. Instead, both right and left headers are continuous blocks that include both upper and lower sections. Where the gap would be on most boards is simply a double-wide space on the header with no hole at all.

Equity, inclusivity and accessibility framework is shown as a diagram. The disgram shows 3 overlapping circles: Multiple Modalities overlapping with Inclusive Collaboration &amp; Distribution of Skills, and Diverse Maker Toolkits (with different material affordances). Multiple Modalities includes Auditory, Tangible and Tactile and Visual Feedback. Inclusive Collaboration &amp; Distribution of Skills includes Targeted Recruitment, Diverse Role Models, Dialogue on Intersecting Experiences, Psychological Safety, Media Criticism and Redesign and Learners as Design Partners.

# Research Questions

### 1. How do learners with visual impairments engage in coding and making activities that are tangibly accessible through a robotics platform?

### 2. How does the accessibility of the tools affect learners’ individual and collaborative interactions?

### 3. What design elements do participants express would be beneficial for equitable learning and collaboration?

* Interaction analysis Jordan and Henderson (1995).

???
interaction analysis (Jordan &amp; Henderson, 1995), as follows: first, the two authors of this paper took detailed content logs, which included annotations of each event; second, we conducted “Interaction Analysis Laboratory (IAL)” sessions where we reviewed and discussed the video footage with trained graduate assistants on the team (N = 3) to identify thematic areas of salience; third, we transcribed the verbal and non-verbal interactions and individually reviewed the videos and the transcripts to triangulate and enrich interpretations; and, finally, we both worked together to mutually cross-check and integrate all of the processes into one holistic narrative.

quote for topic 8:
it might not be possible for me to get very much out a lecture then. I am not actually looking for details. I was just looking for basic big picture
outlines topics. B
ut I feel like when I go to class the other students get those things I do not. I probably can not ask my professor to go slower. maybe it might help if
we actually did wor
k problems class. I had a teacher last semester where for part the class we worked problems groups to see if he understood it that was helping until he
kept pairing me with
 someone who could not speak any. well, she could speak some, but not well enough for me to understand. but most professors do not do that. They are convinced
that the trad
itional lecture style is the most helpful they are going to stay with that. I do wish I could get more out my class while I am actually class, but I guess
that will not be 
possible unless the structure the class inherently changes, that will not happen. I am glad that I have tutoring to help me learn the concepts so I can
still take the cours
e without getting things from the class, but I do think it is sad. honestly, I get so little out my class that if I missed it, it would not really affect
me much, but if I 
missed tutoring, it would set me back a lot.
