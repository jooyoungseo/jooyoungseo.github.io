<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter reports the study findings. As detailed in the previous Chapter, this computational ethnography takes convergent mixed methods design <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-creswell2015concise" role="doc-biblioref">Creswell, 2015</a>)</span> across quantitative and qualitative research. Firstly, a set of data-driven results from computational linguistics will be addressed corresponding to each of the quantitative research questions. Secondly, findings derived from in-depth semi-structured interviews will be shared to respond to two of the qualitative research questions. Finally, I will integrate these two strands to complement each other for a deeper understanding of the hybrid mixed-methods research question. However, a more extensive response to the primary research question will be covered in the next chapter.</p>

<div id="findings-quan-rq" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Results from the Computational Participant-Observation</h2>
<p>In this section, I will report all the data analysis results addressing Chapter <a href="intro.html#quan-rq">1.4.1</a>. For the sake of clarity, each of the data analysis results will be listed under their corresponding research questions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Descriptive Questions</h3>
<div id="quan-rq-1-1" class="section level4" number="4.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Quan RQ1.1: What are the frequency and variation patterns of collective knowledge participations of members in the target mailing listservs between January 2009 and December 2019?</h4>
<p>This question is concerned with the general trends on the four target listservs. As I transformed semi-structured mailing text into one-message-per-row structured tidy data-frame (Chapter <a href="methods.html#transformation">3.8.2</a>), I was able to analyze overall trends of the target communities that I would have otherwise not been able to do with unstructured text in reproducible and efficient ways (Appendix <a href="app-code.html#app-code">I</a>). Table <a href="findings.html#tab:descriptive-summary-table">4.1</a> shows some descriptive information on the four NFB mailing lists. The following include descriptions of what each column indicates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Analysis period</code>: calculated based on the timestamp of the first and the last message instances within each listserv. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was used to normalize different timezones of message senders.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Total active participants</code>: the total number of individuals involved within each listserv calculated by counting each unique email address of message senders.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Total msg instances</code>: the total number of messages sent in the listservs, comprising <code>Number of msg to undefined references</code> (messages replying to undefined <code>message_ID</code> within the given archive) and <code>Number of identifiable msg</code> (messages replying to another identifiable message).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To get more accurate results, I removed <code>Number of msg to undefined references</code> from the calculations for the outcomes below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Number of thread</code>: the total number of the messages having more than one conversation participants.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Number of single msg</code>: the total number of the messages having only one conversation participant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Number of collaborative msg</code>: is the sum of <code>Number of referenced initial msg</code> (the total number of the identifiable original messages referenced by other replies) and <code>Number of replying msg</code> (the number of the replying messages referencing the initial messages).</p></li>
<li><p><code>Total topics</code>: the total number of the unique topics derrived from identifiable unique <code>message_ID</code> within each listserv, which can be broken down into <code>Total replied topics</code> and <code>Total unreplied topics</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Unreplied rate</code>: the ratio of the total number of unreplied original messages to the total number of all the original messages across replied and unreplied ones.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><code>Replied rate</code>: the inverse index to <code>Unreplied rate</code> (<span class="math inline">\(1 - \text{Unreplied Rate}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>Discussion start msg ratio to a total collaborative msg</code>: the ratio of <code>Number of referenced initial msg</code> to <code>Number of collaborative msg</code>.</p></li>

<p>According to the analysis, computer science (CS) was the most active and the Arts was the least participated listserv. For example, the analysis of <code>total msg instances</code> (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-msg-per-list">4.1</a>) revealed that cs had the most participation (13,199 messages), followed by math (9,177), science (2,099), and arts (382). This rank pattern was found in other analyses such as <code>period</code> and <code>number of collaborative msg</code>. However, <code>total active participants</code> showed that math had more active members (684) than cs (538), and also higher replied rate (0.5913) than cs (0.5162).</p>
<p>Although science listserv had more active members (287) than arts (44), it recorded much lower replied rate (0.2567) than arts (0.4641). In terms of <code>discussion start ratio</code>, the arts had the highest rate (0.3111) and the math showed the lowest (0.1796). This suggests members in math list were more likely to reply to other members’ messages than they initiated new messages while members in the arts more tended to start new messages. Table <a href="findings.html#tab:sub-summary-table">4.2</a> briefly illustrates these patterns by the order of higher rank per category.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I counted total number of messages sent by each listserv member and compared the dispersion patterns across different listservs using a box plot. Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-list-member-msg">4.2</a> shows that all the mailing lists had narrow box areas between the first and third quartiles while having long upper whiskers between the third quartiles and maximum values, suggesting highly positive skewness. This implies that all the listservs, regardless of their absolute number of message instances exchanged, were led by few active members. This characteristic was found the most pronounced in the cs list given that it had the largest number of outliers.</p>

<p>Finally, time series analysis indicated that the period between 2011 and 2014 was the most participated years across listservs (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-list-year-n">4.3</a>) while the rate was relatively decreasing towards the end.</p>

<p>To answer this question, I used <code>term frequency–inverse document frequency</code> (tf-idf), which is a weighting term statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a corpus <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sammut2010" role="doc-biblioref">Sammut &amp; Webb, 2010</a>)</span>. Theorem <a href="findings.html#thm:tf-idf-eq">4.1</a> concisely explains this concept.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:tf-idf-eq" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 4.1  (tf-idf theorem.)  </strong></span>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\text{IDF} = \log{\frac{{\text{N}}}{{\text{DF}}}}}\]</span></p>
<span class="math display">\[{\text{TF-IDF} = TF{\times}\log\frac{{\text{N}}}{{\text{DF}}}}\]</span>
</div>
<p>The tf-idf value is useful in the sense that it can isolate a document’s most important words from the kinds of words that tend to be highly frequent across a set of documents in that language <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sammut2010" role="doc-biblioref">Sammut &amp; Webb, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-silge2017text" role="doc-biblioref">Silge &amp; Robinson, 2017</a>)</span>. Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:tf-idf-graph">4.4</a> and Table <a href="app-table.html#tab:tf-idf-table">H.1</a> illustrate what kinds of words appeared to be salient within each listserv based on the top-10 tf-idf values.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>tf-idf</code> results indicated what keywords were the most important concepts within each mailing list. In the <code>arts</code> list, tangible materials (e.g., pottery, fiber, kiln) seemed to be subject to active discussion. The word “craftyfrugalmom” was emergent because it was the online site where one of the list members whose nickname was “crafty frugal mom” sold her handmade products, such as tissue covers. Another active member in the <code>arts</code> list had advertised his music production on the Sound Cloud under the artist name “blindworrell.” Given the small number of membership, the <code>arts</code> corpus was highly affected by few members, resulting in their messages as representative words.</p>
<p>In contrast, the other three mailing lists having relatively larger memberships yielded some reliable results. The <code>cs</code> had operating system keywords (Linux; Microsoft) as well as their keyboard accessibility. Programming languages, such as Java and Cobol, were actively discussed with command line options and an open-source screen reader NVDA. For the <code>math</code> list, many technical terms emerged, such as LaTeX, MathML, MathPlayer because these were the assistive technologies that blind people used when accessing digital Math content in an accessible way. In other words, the members of the <code>math</code> listserv were actively discussing how to utilize such assistive technologies for their math classes, and these were the topics for which people were asking help the most.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>science</code> listserv revealed some intresting keywords, such as “eyesonsuccess,” “episode,” and “podcast.” This is because the eyes on success podcast (<a href="http://eyesonsuccess.net/" class="uri">http://eyesonsuccess.net/</a>) hosted and produced by Peter Torpey and Nancy Goodman Torpey played a central role in the <code>science</code> mailing list corpus. The Torpey’s both have PhD’s in Physics and retired from Xerox Corporation after over 25 years in corporate research. Nancy is sighted and Pete is blind, and the couple produces weekly online podcast episode that contains a wide range of content concerning science accessibility for the blind. Their podcast (EyesOnSuccess) continuously delivered and advocated for science topics for blind individuals to connect with each other.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Semantic Network Questions</h3>
<p>Although the <code>tf-idf</code> analysis provided few important terms in the mailing lists, it did not offer relational information between the words. To investigate semantic network patterns of the target listservs, I conducted the following three network analyses on the corpus. (1) Co-occurrence network analysis; (2) Correlation analysis; and (3) bigram network analysis.</p>
<p>The co-occurrence network analysis, as the collective interconnection of terms, was made based on paired presence of the words within the email corpus. It was calculated by how frequent two words appeared together within a document <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-silge2016tidytext" role="doc-biblioref">Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016</a>)</span>. The correlation network analysis was computed by <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> coefficient, introduced by Karl Pearson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-silge2016tidytext" role="doc-biblioref">Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016</a>)</span>. While the co-occurrence analysis was only focused on the paired presence and their frequencies, the correlation analysis was useful in that it revealed statistically significant interrelation between words. The bigram network analysis was employed to discover more contextual nuance, which the other networks could have had missed, as the nodes’ relations indicated sequential patterns between words <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-silge2016tidytext" role="doc-biblioref">Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016</a>)</span>. I analyzed what kinds of word sequences were highly populated within each listserv using bigram (a pair of sequential two words). Across all the three different networks, I used R package <code>tidygraph</code>’s default centrality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barrat2004architecture" role="doc-biblioref">Barrat et al., 2004</a>)</span>, and added community structure that minimized the expected description length of a random walker trajectory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rosvall2009map" role="doc-biblioref">Rosvall et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-rosvall2007maps" role="doc-biblioref">Rosvall &amp; Bergstrom, 2007</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>While semantic network provides general ideas, topic modeling offers more nuenced themes. To estimate latent topics, I trained multiple Structural Topic Models <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-roberts2013structural" role="doc-biblioref">M. E. Roberts et al., 2013</a>)</span> with different number of topics (K = 20 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 100) based on the <code>content</code> variable that included message body text. The optimal number of topics (K) was chosen based on two strategies: (1) the diagnostic analysis on held-out likelihood and residuals (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-diagnostic">4.18</a>), and (2) relationship analysis between semantic coherence and exclusivity (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-coherence-exclusivity">4.19</a>).</p>

</table>
<p>I found that most of the topics were focused on questions and answers about how to use Windows (topics 26; 6) and Microsoft Office suite (topic 18) with screen-reading software (topic 27). Topic 26, in particular, showed that blind people rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts when using computers. This is because mouse control is challenging for blind people to interact with GUI interfaces. While general computer usage on the Windows operating system seemed to be the most active listserv topics, there were other topics concerning STEM accessibility. For example, topic 9 illustrated active discussions on disability services and accommodations at universities. Topics 19 and 23, on the other hand, were very specific to discussions on math accessibility while topic 4 was about the general information on STEM accessibility meeting at the NFB community.</p>
<p>More advanced listserv discussions were also found. Java programming (topic 21) and Linux system engineering (topic 20) and computer device management (topic 36) revealed that blind people can achieve high-level computational work as long as the related environments are configured to their assistive technologies (e.g., refreshable Braille display = Topic 17; screen readers = Topic = 27).</p>
<p>There were some topics very specific to tactile alternatives. Topics 5, 36, and 38 were concerned about how to use tactile products, such as braille embossers and tactile drawing kits, to alternate visual outcomes which is a critical modality in learning STEM subjects.</p>
<p>However, there were few topics that needed to be filtered out. Topic 7 and 14 were a set of texts for either the listserv email header or email footer. This suggests that unsupervised topic modeling is also useful to identify such trivial patterns that predefined regular expressions could have missed.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.2</span> Quan RQ3.2: In what ways are the estimated structural topics correlated with each other?</h4>
<p>To calculate sophisticated correlation matrix, I used the semiparametric procedure in the R package “huge” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zhao2012huge" role="doc-biblioref">Zhao et al., 2012</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meinshausen2006high" role="doc-biblioref">Meinshausen et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-meinshausen2006high" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> graph estimation. Such estimated topic correlations were visualized using the “igraph” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-csardi2006igraph" role="doc-biblioref">Csardi et al., 2006</a>)</span> package to plot a network where nodes are topics and edges indicate a positive correlation (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-basic-corr-plot">4.20</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.3</span> Quan RQ3.3: How does the rate of topics (i.e., topical prevalence) change over time?</h4>
<p>To answer this question, I fitted a regression model using “stm” package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-stm" role="doc-biblioref">M. Roberts et al., 2019</a>)</span> with “year” being a single covariate after a base spline transformation (see Table <a href="app-table.html#tab:stm-year-regression-table">H.15</a> for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-year prevalence (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) patterns using a heatmap (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-topic-by-year">4.21</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.4</span> Quan RQ3.4: How do these topical distributions (detected from RQ3.1) vary by the four types of the NFB mailing lists?</h4>
<p>This time, I fitted a regression model using “stm” package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-stm" role="doc-biblioref">M. Roberts et al., 2019</a>)</span> with “list” being a single factor covariate (see Table <a href="app-table.html#tab:stm-list-regression-table">H.16</a> for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-list prevalence (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) patterns using a heatmap (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-topic-by-list">4.22</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.5</span> Quan RQ3.5: How do the detected topical distributions vary by the type of mailing lists over time?</h4>
<p>I fitted multi-regression models using “stm” package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-stm" role="doc-biblioref">M. Roberts et al., 2019</a>)</span> with two covariates (i.e., “list” factor and spline-transformed “year” predictor). No interaction effect between the two covariates was considered for this analysis (see Table <a href="app-table.html#tab:stm-list-year-regression-table">H.18</a> for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-year prevalence (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) patterns for each of the four listservs using a heatmap (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-stm-topic-by-list-year">4.23</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Findings from Semi-Structured Interviews</h2>
<p>In parallel with the computational results above, I also conducted semi-structured interviews with eight individuals recruited from the NFB mailing lists to better understand meaning of the discovered knowledge patterns (see Chapter <a href="methods.html#dc-interview">3.7.2</a>).</p>
<p>The interview took place between February 2020 and December 2020, and each of the eight interviews was carried out on Zoom Conference platform due to its great accessibility features for screen readers. Each session lasted approximately an hour following carefully prepared semi-structured interview protocol, which included few questions about their visual impairments, learning experiences in STEM subjects, experience with the NFB mailing lists, and demographic information (see Appendix <a href="app-interview.html#interview-protocol">C.3</a>). With the participants’ consent, all the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for further analysis (Appendix <a href="app-transcripts.html#app-transcripts">D</a> includes interview transcripts).</p>
<p>Throughout the interview process, I was attempting to find answers to the following two research questions. (1) Qual RQ1: What are the common STEM-related issues of blind learners? (2) Qual RQ2: What strategies are utilized by blind individuals to pursue STEM disciplines?</p>
<p>Below are the three saturated thematic results cutting across the two research questions.</p>
<div id="sdl" class="section level3" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Self-Directed Learning Over Lectures</h3>
<p>The first thematic result found from the interview is that blind people tend to rely on self-directed learning strategies over classroom lectures due to inaccessible classroom environments. This means blind people often fall behind in classrooms where instructors use a visual channel as a primary communication. Because of the lack of verbally understandable content, blind learners choose to catch up with the classroom content later on following their pace and alternative learning strategies. To highlight this point, I’d like to share an example of my participants’ experiences.</p>
<p>Participant 1 (P1) was a 32-year-old Caucasian man in San Francisco who was pursuing his Bachelor degree in Physics. He identified his visual impairment level as “Severe vision impairment.” He had been a member of two NFB STEM listservs (i.e., “Science and engineering”; “BlindMath”) for four months as of the interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R: Okay, so what are the most challenging issues for you to learn stem related content as being blind.</p>
<p>P1: So, right now, what’s really difficult is Math and diagrams. Getting math and any sort of diagram or model in an accessible format. And that’s been kind of the biggest hurdle in the classroom so far. In physics, there are a lot of a lot of things are taught using visual aids diagrams and models and stuff so I don’t have access to that.</p>
<p>R: So that’s been probably the biggest issue.</p>
<p>P1: Yeah, as well as getting math equations that are accessible. Ton of equations. I still don’t want to have to memorize them so nice to have a formula sheet.</p>
<p>R: I see, then, how have you addressed those problems and what strategies have you utilized?</p>
<p>P1: So for the formulas I my professor hands out a formula at the beginning of the term. So I’ve made my own accessible version of …</p>
<p>R: Oh, how do you do that?</p>
<p>P1: I just typed it up in word, it’s not very fancy or anything. It’s basically if anyone else were to read it in. Yeah, be confusing, but it works for me. So I just need a generally I have the formulas mostly memorize. Anyways, after hearing all so it’s it’s really just jogged my memory. Basically, when I can. So I am I am starting to learn latex just swing and actually do real good looking math formulas, but just for now I just read stuff in Word documents, that’s</p>
<p>R: WOW Incredible!</p>
<p>P1: Me. Yeah. So my own kind of like personal notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P1 developed his own strategies to organize math formulas against visual and inaccessible classroom learning. In terms of how much information a blind person gets out of STEM lectures, participant 3 (P3) shared related experience during his interview. P3 is a 41-year-old post-doctoral researcher holding a Ph.D. degree in Particle Physics. P3 identified himself as “a totally blind person with zero vision.” He was originally from Pakistan, and moved to the United States when he was 23 for his second Bachelor in Physics. He had been a member of the NFB BlindMath listserv since 2001 (about 18-year subscription).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P3: The classrooms were a little funky because when teachers started writing on the board, it becomes hard to follow. The university used to provide note takers. Some students would be hired to take notes and give them to me, but following the lecture itself was always. I didn’t get too much out of the lectures. I didn’t get that much out of lectures, that was always a problem.</p>
<p>R: I understand.</p>
<p>P3: Even in grad school at times I felt like it was a waste of time to even go to a lecture, so I would stay at home and read. But although I did attend lectures, but in hindsight. If I could do it again, I’m not sure if I would attend the lectures as much or who knows maybe I would, but following lectures was difficult. Even now when I’m attending seminars, people start writing on the board the equations, that’s the part that’s bad, that’s difficult. I do my homework, the same kind of WinTriangle format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The similar struggles of blind learners in STEM classrooms could be found in the collected email corpus as a pronounced pattern. Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:find-thought-sdl">4.24</a> represents some of these voiced by the NFB listserv members.</p>

<div id="linear-verbal-learning" class="section level3" number="4.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Linear Verbal Learning</h3>
<p>The second thematic characteristic is concerned with in what ways blind STEM learners digest such highly vision-dominant information. In other words, I focused on what technologies and modalities blind individuals had been using for their STEM learning.</p>
<p>According to my interviews with eight STEM learners with visual impairments, the most common issue with learning STEM content was math accessibility. Since Mathematics plays a critical role in STEM disciplines as a logical backend <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ramaley2011" role="doc-biblioref">Christenson, 2011</a>)</span>, math accessibility was directly related to students’ success in STEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beck2008advancing" role="doc-biblioref">Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008</a>)</span>. Thus, the following include some excerpts as to how blind learners approached math content. Participant 4 (P4) was a 22-year white female undergrad student pursuing Biochemistry in Delaware. She self-identified her level of visual impairment as “Severe vision impairment.” She had been subscribing to both “Science and engineering” and “BlindMath” listservs for two years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R: Do you tend to go to and ask disability office to provide you with some accessible materials? Or do you communicate directly with your professor first?</p>
<p>P4: It depends on the material so if it’s something that has a lot of mathematical formula, I’ve had some calculus professors who write all of their tests and things in LaTeX. So I knew how to read LaTeX and so they just gave me a digital copy of the test. But for other professors, for example for chemistry, where it is very image-based and does involve a lot of translation and transcription of something visual and something tactile. That’s definitely where I’d involve, disability services because it’s not the professor’s area of expertise.</p>
<p>R: Yeah. Okay. Let me ask this question, you mentioned you’re using LaTeX.</p>
<p>P4: Yes.</p>
<p>R: What other technology do you use specifically for your math and science classes like MathML or other?</p>
<p>P4: I do use MathML in a lot of cases, when I get textbooks, for example my physics textbook is in MathML. And so I use that in grids for the braille display so I can read equations for easily, it’s helpful to have the braille display as well as speech to make sure I’m not missing anything. So I’d say that’s primarily what I do, I tend to avoid hard copy braille whenever I can. And lately as you know [crosstalk 00:14:22].</p>
<p>R: Because of the bulky volume.</p>
<p>P4: Yeah. So bulky, yeah.</p>
<p>R: LaTeX is really complex when it gets longer.</p>
<p>P4: It is. Yes.</p>
<p>R: So do you primarily use LaTeX for a writing purpose or reading purpose?</p>
<p>P4: I would say primarily for reading purposes, I have a shorter hand notation that I use to work problems. But if the professor asks that to be translated into LaTeX I can. Typically what I will do is write, if the professor knows LaTeX, I’ll write my final answer in LaTeX and if they’re curious about my work, they can go back and look at the shorthand notation that… I typically just use Computer Braille when I’m writing out because I realized Nemeth is great and everything; but it takes up a little bit more room than Computer Braille does. So I’ve realized that because in Computer Braille you don’t have to have the number symbol at the front, you don’t have to have the equal sign takes up two cells instead of one. So that was just a decision I made based on efficiency.</p>
<p>R: Awesome. What’s your special strategy for the back translation between Braille Nemeth Code and sided print.</p>
<p>P4: So it depends, I would say since I do a lot of my stuff visually, it just depends on what the professor wants. Like I said, if the professor knows LaTeX then I just write out my answers in LaTeX and use MathType or some other add-on to convert that to a PDF and then either email it to a TA or whoever’s grading it. Or for example, if I’m taking a test in the disability office, they’ll typically put the test on a flash drive, I will take the test and then they’ll somehow either print it out; or get it to the professor that way or somehow find a way to get it to them digitally. And especially this semester, professors have been great about TAs or whoever’s grading has been great about getting me things back in a digital format. So that I can actually see, “Okay, here’s what I wrote,” potentially any comments or anything the professor made. So that I’m not having to rely on sighted assistance to read me back my graded papers, which is nice.</p>
<p>R: Cool. P4, did you go to special school for the blind?</p>
<p>P4: I did not. I was mainstreamed my whole life.</p>
<p>R: Then, how did you learn the math code and LaTeX and other blind skills for STEM.</p>
<p>P4: So in early life, I had a teacher of the visually impaired so it was from, I would say early childhood all the way up until eighth grade. And then in high school, I was actually in a private high school so I did not have a teacher of the visually impaired. So a lot of the STEM related skills that I learned other than, I learned Nemeth in early elementary school and things like that. But I really did teach myself a lot, I taught myself LaTeX so it was very much… My motivation was there and so I pretty much told myself, “Okay, here’s a solution to this problem, here’s how to…” Because it’s hard for someone to teach you a programming language [crosstalk 00:17:49] you have to teach yourself. So that’s how it ended up working out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in the excerpt above, blind students rely heavily on LaTeX, a plaintext typeset system, when reading and writing Math content. This general tendency can be found in the Math list corpus as reported in Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:math-network-cors">4.11</a>. According to <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-seo2019arow" role="doc-biblioref">Seo &amp; McCurry</a> (<a href="#ref-seo2019arow" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, LaTeX has been widely used and recommended among blind people in STEM disciplines; however, it requires a steep learning curve. For example, the Theorem <a href="findings.html#thm:latex-example">4.2</a> illustrates what LaTeX markup looks like.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p><span id="thm:latex-example" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 4.2  (LaTeX example theorem.)  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
\]</span></p>
<p>is the result of the following LaTeX code:</p>
<code>\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}</code>
</div>
<p>Since LaTeX markup is presented in a linear fashion, it demands a heavier cognitive cost than image display in human short-term memory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark1991dual" role="doc-biblioref">Clark &amp; Paivio, 1991</a>)</span>. As P4 mentioned, on the other hand, blind students often utilize refreshable braille display, the hardware device for presenting literary braille chords in a tactile form (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:brl-display">4.25</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:brl-display"></span>
<img src="fig/brl-display.jpg" alt="Refreshable braille display.." width="497" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.25: Refreshable braille display..
</p>
</div>
<p>Although such assistive technology can reduce some short-term memory cost, the linear nature of braille system makes it hard for blind people to get a high level picture of complex equations which would typically be represented in a two-dimensional visual form for sighted people <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beck2008advancing" role="doc-biblioref">Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-seo2019arow" role="doc-biblioref">Seo &amp; McCurry, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="positive-attitudes" class="section level3" number="4.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Positive Attitudes</h3>
<p>The third thematic finding suggests that the interviewees did not consider their visual impairments as a stumbling block for learning STEM content; rather, they leveraged the visual challenges as a source of problem-solving efforts. The following interview excerpt of the participant 4 (P4) clearly illustrates this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P4: And then in college I actually started out at a small liberal arts school in Virginia and then I realized as I got more involved with my degree, I was originally a pre-med student. And then I realized I enjoyed chemistry and that there wasn’t a lot of computational chemistry opportunities. And a lot of people ask me, “Did you go into computational chemistry because you’re blind? Was it something you felt relegated to?” And I felt like I love computer science and I love writing code and so I was excited because computational chemistry was my two loves all in one thing. <code>[00:02:30 - 00:03:08]</code>
. . . . . .
R: As far as I understand, the reason why you were seeking computational chemistry specifically is because of your blindness?</p>
<p>P4: Actually not necessarily, I just personally really enjoy computational chemistry and I’ve always really liked the theory behind chemistry more than I’ve liked being in the lab. So I wouldn’t say that it’s because of my blindness, I’d just say more of that’s what I enjoy most about chemistry. <code>[00:09:49 - 00:10:21]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, most of the interviewees had positive attitudes towards STEM disciplines regardless of their visual impairments. To highlight this point, I am sharing the three questions about their perception on STEM that I asked to each of the eight participants. The participants’ major and demographic information can be found in Table <a href="methods.html#tab:interview-demographics">3.3</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1. I feel learning STEM subjects is ___.</li>
</ul>
<p>P1: Fascinating rewarding but very difficult.</p>
<p>P2: [inaudible]</p>
<p>P3: Interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>P4: Challenging and rewarding.</p>
<p>P5: Challenging, but ultimately rewarding.</p>
<p>P6: Empowering.</p>
<p>P7: A wise career path for blind students.</p>
<p>P8: Hard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q2. I think pursuing STEM disciplines as being blind is ___.</li>
</ul>
<p>P1: It’s great. I wish more people did it.</p>
<p>P2: It’s challenging, and it’s very hard work and a deep attention to pursue STEM filling in.</p>
<p>P3: Possible, but requires determination.</p>
<p>P4: There’s so much I want to say. I’m trying to… Okay, let’s see. I would say an adventure.</p>
<p>P5: A viable goal.</p>
<p>P6: Powerful.</p>
<p>P7: Challenging but not impossible.</p>
<p>P8: Worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q3. To succeed in STEM fields, a blind person needs ___.</li>
</ul>
<p>P1: Support and opportunities from friends, family and basically faculty.</p>
<p>P2: HTML. He has to. He has to put an extra effort.</p>
<p>P3: Hard work and determination and somewhat more than your other sighted peers.</p>
<p>P4: To be a strong advocate and to be a problem solver.</p>
<p>P5: I’m not sure of how to keep it to one sentence, but I think that the biggest thing is that they need to not have a fear of failure. What worked for one person might not work for them, you might need to try five different sources of information until you finally find one that clicks or maybe you need to try something multiple times before you find the way. There’s almost always a way as long as you can keep whatever drives you internally to continue moving forward, as long as you can keep that, then you can find a way.</p>
<p>P6: Persevere.</p>
<p>P7: Motivation and perseverance.</p>
<p>P8: Tenacity.</p>
<p>As stated in each of the participants’ excerpts, STEM is perceived as an area of possible adventure. The general trend of blind people’s positive attitude for STEM fields can be found in the sentimental analysis of the NFB mailing corpus (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:sentimentr-barplot">4.26</a>). In sum, despite various challenges, blind people pursuing STEM disciplines tended to focus on their capabilities rather than difficiencies.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Comprehensive Results</h2>
<p>Although each separate strand of the computational and qualitative data analyses offers their own investigative values, it is not quite clear for audience to get a sense of the analytical points in a concise manner. For example, interpretation of the results from the computational linguistics may be challenging for those not having any prior contextual information or knowledge on the target community. The structural topic modeling results, in particular, do not make sense without an extensive further exploration and/or interactions with the original document sources. Furthermore, the patterns that emerged out of the structural topic models make it difficult to understand due to its massive information (K = 40). The qualitative data, on the other hand, offers a deeper interpretative ground for audience. Still, it may miss general patterns as it tends to highlight some detailed phenomena out of discourse text.</p>
<p>One of the effective ways to address these issues is mixing the strong points of the two strands. That is, integrating the computational patterns into the qualitative interpretations.</p>
<p>From the unsupervised machine learning offered by abductive structural topic models (Chapter <a href="findings.html#findings-quan-rq-stm">4.2.3</a>), I obtained various patterns of the 40 topics. From the semi-structured interviews with eight individuals with visual impairments in STEM fields (Chapter <a href="findings.html#findings-qual-rq">4.3</a>), I developed how to interpret these patterns. What I am trying to do in the next section is to deductively refine the computationally captured patterns through an interpretative lense developed by the iterative communication with my eight blind informants.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Mixed RQ: What results emerge from comparing the qualitative interviews about the STEM-learning experiences of blind individuals with the computational outcomes derived from the STEM-oriented listservs?</h3>
<p>To respond to this hybrid mixed-method research question, I reduced the 40 topics of the structural topic models into 9 interpretative codes. For this pattern refinement process, I rested upon the “Ecological Model of STEM Education” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-basham2010ecological" role="doc-biblioref">Basham et al., 2010</a>)</span> as primary categories (see Chapter <a href="lit-review.html#ecological-model">2.4.1</a>). Although <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-basham2010ecological" role="doc-biblioref">Basham et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-basham2010ecological" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> originally suggested four nested systems for inclusive STEM education (i.e., macro-; exo-; meso-; and microsystem), the macrosystem–the foremost worldwide level including social and political impact on global STEM education system–was excluded for this coding process as the scope went beyond the current target corpus data. Table <a href="findings.html#tab:code-scheme-table">4.13</a> shows how I refined the coding schemes.</p>

<p>Based on the coding scheme, I deductively and interpretively assigned binary code (1 or 0) to each of the mailing list documents. More specifically, I used nested <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> mean threshold (grouped by list, year, and topic) to determine the code assignment. I gave “TRUE” (i.e., 1) value to topics higher than the mean threshold, otherwise “FALSE” (i.e., 0) value (see Appendix <a href="app-code.html#app-code">I</a>).</p>
<p>Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-code-year">4.27</a> is the visualized result of code-by-year patterns that I obtained by counting the number of “TRUE” binary code by year across all the four NFB STEM mailing lists.</p>
<p>Discussions on screen-reader use emerged as the most significant pattern over time, followed by math-related technologies (e.g., LaTeX; MathML), which belong to “microsystem” of the ecological STEM education. That is, blind people were active in discussing how to utilize assistive technologies that could play a critical role in their STEM learning contexts. There were few relatively weaker, yet stable, patterns within macrosystem, such as discussions on tactile graphs, programming, and mobile_apps. I assume that these were special topics discussed among some groups of members over time. The text-to-tactile system for blind people, Braille and its related technologies, was the least emerging code within the “microsystem” category, which may be related to “braille literacy crisis” that less than 10 percent school-age children in the United States can read and write braille <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nfb-braille-crisis" role="doc-biblioref">Jernigan Institute, 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-nbp-braille-crisis" role="doc-biblioref">National Braille Press, n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, community support, such as the NFB Annual Convension, STEM extension workshop tailored for blind students, and online broadcast programs (e.g., EyesOnSuccess Podcast) showed a consistently strong trend over. This indicates “exosystem,” which speaks to how well state and regional community supports STEM education <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-basham2010ecological" role="doc-biblioref">Basham et al., 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, codes representing “mesosystem,” such as job and classroom accessibility revealed fewer frequencies, which could be interpreted in either way: (1) Blind people were more intersted in technical topics on how to use a set of assistive technologies for learning STEM content at their individual level rather than discussing the STEM accessibility at a mesosystem level; or (2) This pattern may reveal the lack of mesosystem accessibility consideration in STEM classrooms and workplaces. I will revisit this point in the next chapter for further discussions.</p>
<p>These all the patterns had on-and-off trends, and the frequencies in 2010, 2015, and 2019 years were found to be the lowest.</p>

Figure 4.27: Heatmap showing code count by year.
</p>
</div>
<p>To take a closer look at these captured patterns, I also visualized code-by-year nested by each of the four NFB STEM mailing lists. Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-code-list-year">4.28</a> illustrates the results.</p>
<p>While the overall patterns discovered in Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-code-year">4.27</a> can also be found this time, there are few notable interesting points.</p>
<p>First, the cs and math lists seemed active over time whereas the arts and science were less participated. This aligns with the first result conducted in Chapter <a href="findings.html#findings-quan-rq-descriptive">4.2.1</a>. Second, while the cs had stable patterns until 2019, the math, which had stronger participation than the cs in 2011, became somewhat decreasing in recent years. Finally, despite the importance of braille literacy in the math, the discourse concerning braille was not found to be significant among the members of the listserv compared to other codes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter reported computational and qualitative results separately and combine the two strands at the end. The computational analyses revealed that computer science (CS) was the most active and the Arts was the least participated listserv. Although science listserv had more active members (287) than arts (44), it recorded much lower replied rate (0.2567) than arts (0.4641).</p>
<p>The dispersion patterns of the total number of messages sent by each listserv member showed that all the listservs, regardless of their absolute number of message instances exchanged, were led by few active members. This characteristic was found the most pronounced in the cs list given that it had the largest number of outliers (Figure <a href="findings.html#fig:g-list-member-msg">4.2</a>).</p>
<p>Semantic analyses including co-occurrence, correlation, and bigram networks, revealed that unique linguistic and knowledge-sharing patterns on each of the mailing lists, and these were confirmed with more advanced structural topic models (STM) fitted with 40 topics.</p>
<p>The semi-structured interview findings with eight individuals who are blind or visually impaired yielded three themes: (1) Self-directed learning over lectures; (2) Linear verbal learning; and (3) Positive attitudes. These were repeatedly confirmed with both computational results as well as cross-interview checking.</p>
<p>The hybrid mixed-method result that combined both computational and interpretative strands allowed me to deductively reduce the structural topic model patterns into 9 codes based on the nested systems introduced in “Ecological Model of STEM Education” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-basham2010ecological" role="doc-biblioref">Basham et al., 2010</a>)</span>. By analyzing both “code-by-year” and “code-by-year-by-list” patterns, it was found that microsystem-level technologies, such as screen readers and math-technologies accounted for most of the code patterns across all the corpus documents. In contrast, mesosystem-level conversations, such as support from and for schools and workplaces in STEM learning, was lacking. Furthermore, despite the importance of braille literacy in STEM education and its positive correlation with employment rate <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nbp-braille-crisis" role="doc-biblioref">National Braille Press, n.d.</a>)</span>, knowledge-sharing patterns around braille was less pronounced compared to other microsystem technologies. This was congruent with current braille literacy crisis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nfb-braille-crisis" role="doc-biblioref">Jernigan Institute, 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I will conclude this study by circling back around to primary research question.</p>
