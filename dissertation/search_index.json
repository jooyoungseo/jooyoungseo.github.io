Despite the comprehensive need for STEM literacy and its positive effect on learning, students with disabilities who are increasingly participating in regular classrooms experience significant difficulties in STEM; blind students, in particular, have become even more disenfranchised with the visually-oriented STEM practices. While several attempts have been made to address STEM accessibility issues for the blind, existing studies have been primarily limited to either usability field test or special curriculum design from a top-down approach taken by researchers with little attention devoted to bottom-up research where the lived experiences of blind STEM learners, as central storytellers, are naturally portrayed to yield their own challenges and shared cultures. This study aims to discover collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing STEM disciplines as captured through computer-mediated mailing listservs. Using the National Federation of the Blind Mailing List, which is one of the worlds largest online mailing communities for the blind, this research conducts longitudinal computational ethnography for the four STEM-oriented listserv archives in the public domain (i.e., NFB-Science and Engineering; Computer Science; Artists-Making-Art; BlindMath) between January 2009 and December 2019 to develop a comprehensive understanding of learning experiences voiced by blind individuals. Throughout this study across a total of 24858 messages, the following primary research question will be investigated: What are the sociocultural characteristics of collective knowledge-sharing patterns produced by blind learners pursuing STEM disciplines? The findings of this dissertation study should make an important contribution to the field of Learning Sciences by discussing How Blind People Learn STEM and How a Blind Learning Scientist Researches through rigorous, reliable, and reproducible methods offered by computational ethnography, where computer-assisted text analysis and humanistic deep interpretation complement each other.

Although the actual definition of STEM education and the consensus of the extent of the subjects interconnectedness still remains unclear (D. Bell, 2016; J. Brown, 2012; Capraro et al., 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; A. Roberts, 2013), it is now generally accepted that recent STEM education, as a dynamic process that changes over time, represents the purposeful integration either between the four subjects or with various other disciplines (e.g., languages; designs; the arts) whereby learners are engaged into solving real-world problem practices (Breiner et al., 2012; Labov et al., 2010; Sanders, 2009). STEM has many implications for current learning systems. From a broader global view, for example, traditional manufacturing jobs have quickly been replaced with careers demanding an applied STEM knowledge in many countries to secure economic prosperity (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; D. Bell, 2016; Kaku, 2012). Hwang &amp; Taylor (2016), on the other hand, argue, knowledge in STEM helps students to live a better quality of life because STEM is fully embedded in daily life situations (p. 40). In fact, recent years have witnessed traditional lecture-based teaching strategies increasingly replaced with more project-based learning design (Breiner et al., 2012) to foster inquiry-driven nature, which in turn enhances high-order thinking, such as fundamental scientific, quantitative, and critical thinking skills, moving beyond low-level cognitive tasks (e.g., recalling facts in isolation) (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Taken all together, as Zollman (2012) claims, being STEM proficient can address not only societal, but also personal needs for a fulfilled citizenry in an increasingly global economy (Hughes, 2010; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016). 1.2 Research Problem: A Knowledge Gap Despite this comprehensive need for STEM literacy, students with disabilities, who have been increasingly participating in regular classrooms with the legislative support for equal access to general education (Rao et al., 2014; K. D. Roberts et al., 2011), experience significant difficulties in STEM (Israel et al., 2013). Students with disabilities continuously perform below their peers without disabilities on standardized measures in STEM subjects (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; Israel et al., 2013), and often fall behind in STEM content since middle school (Israel et al., 2013; Marino, 2010). This disengagement has led to a rare presence of those with disabilities in the STEM workforce as only about 5 percent of students with disabilities enter STEM careers (Leddy, 2010). However, a few studies have pointed out the struggles come primarily from the dearth of accessible teaching materials, inclusive curricula, and experiences of instructors teaching students with disabilities rather than students disabilities themselves (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Martin et al., 2011; Thurston et al., 2017). Martin et al. (2011) argue, In order to be afforded equal opportunity, especially in STEM fields, people with disabilities must be able to work their way through multiple barriers (p. 295). This implies that more inclusive STEM materials and scaffolding learning designs are imperative for students with disabilities to fully engage with STEM content so that students are not left with all the responsibilities for their own STEM frustration (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Samsonov et al., 2006; Thurston et al., 2017). While each individual with disabilities still lacks accessible STEM curricula, blind students, in particular, experience extra challenges and have become even more disenfranchised with STEM subjects (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Cryer, 2013; Edwards et al., 2006; Gardner, 2002; Jones et al., 2006; Supalo et al., 2006). According to American Printing House for the Blind (2017), there are approximately 63,657 U.S. children, youth, and adult students in educational settings (between the age of 0 and 21) who are legally blind (i.e., those with central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, or visual field of 20 degrees or less). Globally, there are approximately 1.3 billion people with some varying degree of visual impairments, and 36 million of whom are blind (i.e., visual acuity worse than 3/60, World Health Organization, 2018). These people have consistently faced the following issues when engaging with STEM content. First, material accessibility issue. As STEM materials and curricula are designed in ways that heavily rely on visual models, those who cannot employ visual sense for their learning encounter rudimentary barriers in accessing such information unlike sighted counterparts (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Cryer, 2013). Second, instructional inclusivity issue. Teachers and instructors in the general education system are often unfamiliar with non-visual teaching methods for STEM content, which keeps unintentionally marginalizing their blind students in classes (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Fraser &amp; Maguvhe, 2008; Gardner, 2002). Third, networking issue. As blind students have increasingly become integrated into regular classrooms with the support of legislation advocating for equal access for all (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act, 1997, 2004; Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990; Sections 504 (1973) and 508 (1998) of the Rehabilitation Act), they are frequently the only non-visual learners in classes. In other words, they lack natural opportunities to meet blind peers or adults who can possibly serve as role models to inspire them to develop confidence in STEM subjects (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Finally, low social and self- expectation issue. Teachers, parents, and blind students themselves do not hold high expectations towards success in STEM areas because of blindness (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Martin et al., 2011). In spite of these critical lags behind their sighted counterparts, scant research has been devoted to investigating How Blind People Learn STEM in scientific ways with a hasty conclusion that a costly retrofitted change must be required for their special needs (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Although several valuable attempts have been made to address these issues by initiating organizations (AccessSTEM, n.d.; The National Center for Blind Youth in Science, 2004), offering STEM workshops and programs (Fraser &amp; Maguvhe, 2008; Supalo et al., 2006, 2009), and designing accessible STEM materials (Ferreira &amp; Freitas, 2004; Jones et al., 2006; Karshmer &amp; Bledsoe, 2002; Levy &amp; Lahav, 2012; Singh, 2008) tailored for blind students, these existing studies have primarily relied upon either usability field test (Edwards et al., 2006; Gardner, 2002) or special curriculum design (Supalo et al., 2009) from a top-down approach taken by researchers where blind individuals are regarded as ultimate subjects for evaluating the usefulness of their proposed products and/or instructions. To put it another way, there still remains a paucity of bottom-up research in which the lived experiences of blind STEM learners, as central storytellers, are naturally portrayed to yield their own challenges and shared cultures in greater detail that can deepen our understanding of their learning patterns. Moreover, currently, neither systematically quantitative nor in-depth qualitative data exists that examines what specifically prevents blind individuals from learning STEM disciplines and how they attempt to address these barriers by themselves as blind STEM learners beyond simply being either passive or dependent on others' help. With the support of the Internet and assistive technology (e.g., screen reading software and refreshable braille display hardware), in the meantime, blind individuals all over the world have increasingly become connected to each other, and the mailing list is one of the widely used accessible bridging media between them. In other words, recently much of informal learning and knowledge sharing communications among blind people has been accumulated through computer-mediated mailing list archives, which could provide us with great investigative value. 1.3 Purpose of the Study This study is proposed to discover such collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines as captured through computer-mediated mailing listservs. Using the worlds largest online mailing lists for the blind (National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists, n.d.), this research will conduct computational ethnography (Abramson et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2015) for the four STEM-oriented listserv archives in the public domain (i.e., NFB-Science and Engineering; Computer Science; Artists-Making-Art; BlindMath) between January 2009 and December 2019 to develop a comprehensive understanding of learning experiences voiced by blind individuals. More specifically, a total of 24858 messages (2099 messages from Science &amp; Engineering; 13199 NFB in Computer Science; 382 Artists-Making-Art; 9178 BlindMath) will be collected and analyzed throughout this study. This is, to my knowledge, one of the largest corpora of texts where blind individuals describe their stories, challenges, and solutions for STEM learning experiences in their own words at a community level (National Federation of the Blind, n.d.) that has not been fabricated by any third-party researcher(s). However, this text-as-data research requires its unique analytical procedures that may differ from other traditional or singular quantitative or qualitative approaches. For example, conventional quantitative methods, which take either numerical or predefined-categorical variable(s) for its analyses, cannot be readily applied to this unstructured text data. On the other hand, it is logistically infeasible for either a single or even multiple researcher(s) to qualitatively read and code all of the 10-year text communications in a reasonable timeframe with a reliable consistency (Nelson et al., 2018; M. E. Roberts et al., 2013). This study, thus, will employ the concept of computational ethnography defined as using both computer-assisted algorithms and humanistic deep interpretation to explore a meaningful discovery out of a large amount of textual data (Zheng et al., 2015). Computational ethnography is one of the recently developed mixed methods in which exploratory data science techniques (e.g., descriptive analysis; clustering analysis; social network analysis; relational analysis) are applied to a large-scale (or more, big data sized) corpora of texts and employed to help researchers uncover meaningful patterns of the target data in the least intrusive fashion which would otherwise be infeasible to analyze with conventional qualitative approaches (Abramson et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2015). In other words, typical computational ethnography study involves descriptive and syntactical pattern discovery assisted by computer algorithms first, then followed by researchers deep interpretation of the detected patterns to relate it to semantical explanation, and this mixed-method interaction between data-driven computation and context-driven interpretation iteratively contributes to one another until a comprehensive understanding of the data is saturated (Nelson, 2017; David Williamson Shaffer, 2017). This novel methodology, therefore, requires both computer skills to control algorithms in a technological manner and deep understanding of the target subjects to situate the quantified results within a contextual fashion. As a more than 10-year programmer, I have some proven expertise in software engineering and package development in the open-source statistical computing R community (R Core Team, 2019; Seo &amp; Choi, 2019), and at the same time, I, as a blind researcher, have investigated accessibility issues and STEM-related topics for blind learners for several years (Seo, 2018, 2019; Seo &amp; Richard, 2018). Hence, I believe that my background can meet the readiness of this method in some ways. 1.4 Research Questions This study seeks to answer the following research questions. Primary RQ: What are the sociocultural characteristics of collective knowledge-sharing patterns produced by blind learners pursuing STEM disciplines? The primary research question can be broken down into several sub-questions which are listed below: 1.4.1 Quantitative Research Questions Firstly, as a bird-eye view approach, the following data-driven research questions are explored in order to guide the overall question systematically. 1.4.1.1 Descriptive Questions Quan RQ1.1: What are the frequency and variation patterns of collective knowledge participations of members in the target mailing listservs between January 2009 and December 2019? Quan RQ1.2: What are the top-10 most participated topics among members found in the target online listservs? Quan RQ1.3: What are the most salient words in each of the four target listservs? 1.4.1.2 Semantic Network Questions Quan RQ2: What are the semantic network patterns found in each of the four target listservs? Quan RQ2.1: What are the most common co-occurring words in each mailing list? Quan RQ2.2: What are the most correlated words in each mailing list? Quan RQ2.3: What are the most common bigrams (a pair of two words) in each mailing list? 1.4.1.3 Data Clustering Questions Quan RQ3.1: What are estimated latent topics across all of the four target mailing lists calculated by Structural Topic Models? (simply stated, What kinds of conversations are provoked across all of the four NFB mailing lists?) Quan RQ3.2: In what ways are the estimated structural topics correlated with each other? Quan RQ3.3: How does the rate of topics (i.e., topical prevalence) change over time? Quan RQ3.4: How do these topical distributions (detected from RQ3.1) vary by the four types of the NFB mailing lists? Quan RQ3.5: How do the detected topical distributions vary by the type of mailing lists over time? 1.4.2 Qualitative Research Questions Secondly, the following research questions are addressed based on the semi-structured interviews with the members (i.e., informants) of the NFB STEM-oriented mailing lists. Qual RQ1: What are the common STEM-related issues of blind learners? Qual RQ2: What strategies are utilized by blind individuals to pursue STEM disciplines 1.4.3 Hybrid Mixed Methods Question At the end, the following research question is answered by combining the quantitative and qualitative research findings. Mixed RQ: What results emerge from comparing the qualitative interviews about the STEM-learning experiences of blind individuals with the computational outcomes derived from the STEM-oriented listservs? 1.5 Significance and Value of the Study The findings of this dissertation study should make an important contribution to the field of the Learning Sciences in the following ways. Firstly, this scientific investigation of How blind people learn STEM can bring meaningful discussion points to the field. Although How People \\[emphasis added\\] Learn should be applied to any inquiries of the Learning Sciences, current scholarly efforts in the field have been largely devoted to learning improvements from and for so-called able-bodied viewpoints. In other words, the field has yet neglected to extend the scope of learners across dis/abilities while leaving the topic for special education. This dissertation will serve not only to shed light on a blind spot of the separation between general VS. special education paradigm, but also to draw holistic attention of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, curriculum developers, and others towards the need for inclusive STEM learning ecology where sighted and blind learners are all taken into account under the fundamental question of How People Learn. Secondly, the research can suggest a novel methodology to investigate large corpora of texts in rigorous, reliable, and reproducible ways. Drawing upon analytical procedure of the five phases of Knowledge Discovery in Textual Databases [KDT; Feldman &amp; Dagan (1995)] combined with the three-step Computational Grounded Theory (Nelson, 2017), this study will detail each phase of the proposed investigative phenomenon, which is often an underexplored approach in traditional qualitative research, to offer the readers reproducible trustworthiness across the study holistically. Finally, this dissertation can describe how a blind learning scientist researches. Unlike either special education or social welfare fields, finding a researcher who is blind is quite rare. Moreover, little is known about the challenges and solutions of a blind person from a researchers perspective going beyond study subjects. I, as a lifelong blind person myself, will self-report on how I research from data collection to analysis throughout this study to inspire other sighted and blind learning scientists to look into non-visual techniques in the field where video-based interaction analysis is dominant. 1.6 Possible Study Limitations It should be advised, however, the data that this research deals with cannot represent all blind individuals in the world despite its popularity since: (1) the target listservs only allow English-speaking membership communications which cannot reflect any voices of blind learners who use different languages; (2) some technologies discussed among the members are not available in all countries; and (3) it is hard to retrieve the members demographic information, which might have effects on their STEM learning phenomenon, due to the anonymous identity of public email data. Therefore, a full discussion of the study generalizability lies beyond the scope of this study. 1.7 Chapter Summary This chapter has covered some backgrounds and purposes of the dissertation study. Although STEM literacy has become increasingly needed and important, those who are blind or visually impaired are unintentionally disenfranchised within this 21st-century ethos. Several attempts have been made to address STEM accessibility issues for the blind. Yet existing studies have been limited primarily either to usability field testing or to special curriculum design, in the top-down approach taken by researchers. Little attention has been devoted to bottom-up research, where the lived experiences of blind STEM learners, as central storytellers, are portrayed naturally as yielding their own challenges and shared cultures. This dissertation study aims to discover such collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing STEM disciplines as captured through the National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists (n.d.). Utilizing computational ethnography (Abramson et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2015) that combines data-driven computation and context-driven humanistic interpretation of a large corpus, I as a blind learning scientist will investigate How blind people learn STEM and detail How a blind learning scientist researches. The findings of this dissertation study should make an important contribution to the field of the Learning Sciences by shedding light on understudied subject topic, methodological implication of computational ethnography, and scholarly journey of a blind researcher towards an inclusive STEM learning ecology.

There are two lines of literature that this study rests upon. First concerns STEM education; second involves computer-assisted text analysis. The former, as a content-oriented review, covers the definition, theoretical and pedagogical backgrounds, and existing issues of STEM education in general (see Chapter 2.2 through 2.5). The latter, on the other hand, is method-oriented. This walks through some methodological backgrounds that this research employs (see Chapter 2.6). 2.2 What is STEM? At the outset, what we mean by STEM should be defined. A search of the literature from the past 10 years yields that the term STEM was first used as a government arrangement, particularly from inside the National Science Foundation (NSF) (Breiner et al., 2012). In the early 1990s, NSF originally utilized the acronym SMET (Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology) to refer to the career areas in those disciplines or educational modules that coordinate information and abilities from those areas. In 2001, however, the term was rearranged to STEM (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics curriculum) by Judith Ramaley, a former director of education and human resources at NSF to avoid issues of vulgarity (Breiner et al., 2012; Christenson, 2011; Sanders, 2009). While Ramaley (2011) originally employed the term to develop a coherent, not necessarily integrated, curriculum where science and mathematics served as bookends for technology and engineering (as cited in Christenson, 2011, emphasis added), some still follow this initial stance by defining STEM as separate knowledge bases (R. L. Bell &amp; Lederman, 2003; Clough, 2000); others perceive the concept as the generic label of a higher category spanning four areas (Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016, p. 39) across various disciplines (Kaufman et al., 2003; Morrison, 2006). Although the actual definition of STEM education and the consensus of the extent of their interconnectedness still remain unclear parameters (D. Bell, 2016; J. Brown, 2012; Capraro et al., 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; A. Roberts, 2013), it is now generally accepted that recent STEM education, as a dynamic process that changes over time, represents the purposeful integration either between the four subjects or with various other disciplines (e.g., languages; designs; the arts) whereby learners are engaged into solving real-world problem practices (Breiner et al., 2012; Labov et al., 2010; Sanders, 2009). For example, NSF characterizes STEM areas broadly, including not only the common categories of mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and computer and information sciences, but also such social/behavioral sciences as psychology, economics, sociology, and political science (as cited in Breiner et al., 2012, p. 4). In a similar vein, Sanders (2009), one of the leading scholars in STEM education, defines the scope of STEM as follows: STEM education includes approaches that explore teaching and learning among any two or more of the STEM subject areas, and/or between a STEM subject and one or more other school subjects (p. 21, emphasis added). Likewise, recently many scholars posit that STEM does not have to be bounded by the four subjects; rather, other disciplines such as the Arts, linguistics, and designs can be integrated with them to better cultivate our problem-solving skills (Christenson, 2011; Heil et al., 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; Kaufman et al., 2003; Zollman, 2012). In sum, as Breiner et al. (2012) stated, the notion of integration might be the most important modern conception of STEM education (p. 5). Taking this broader viewpoint, in what follows, I will use the term STEM not only to mean the symbiotic relationship among the four interwoven fields (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013, p. 9), but also the purposeful integration with various other disciplines such as languages, designs, and the arts whereby learners are engaged into solving real-world problem practices (Breiner et al., 2012; Labov et al., 2010; Sanders, 2009). STEM has many implications for current learning systems. From a broader global view, for example, STEM literacy has been increasingly recognized as being critical for current and future workforce ecologies. Traditional manufacturing jobs have quickly been replaced with careers demanding an applied STEM knowledge in many countries to secure economic prosperity (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; D. Bell, 2016; Kaku, 2012). According to the U.S. Department of Education (2015), nearly 62 percent of the fastest growing jobs require proficient STEM-related knowledge or skills (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; Kaku, 2012). Breiner et al. (2012) describes as to how this global trend can lead to reshaping education, as follows: As the federal government has made STEM a top priority in funding, multiple agencies have been vying for these dollars. Programs have been established as joint ventures between various agencies within government, business, institutions of higher education (IHE), parents, and existing K-12 school systems. (p. 3) Besides the importance of STEM from a global perspective, on the other hand, STEM education possesses valuable impacts on teaching and learning (Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016). Zollman (2012) highlights we should move from learning for STEM literacy to the ability to use STEM literacy for continued learning beyond defining STEM education (p. 18, emphasis added). Following his emphasis on the need for STEM literacy, Hwang &amp; Taylor (2016) argue, knowledge in STEM helps students to live a better quality of life because STEM is fully embedded in daily life situations (p. 40). In fact, recent years have witnessed traditional lecture-based teaching strategies have been increasingly replaced with more project-based learning design (Breiner et al., 2012) to foster inquiry-driven nature, which in turn enhances high-order thinking, such as fundamental scientific, quantitative, and critical thinking skills, moving beyond low-level cognitive tasks (e.g., recalling facts in isolation) (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Taken all together, as Zollman (2012) claims, being STEM proficient can address not only societal, but also personal needs to be a fulfilled citizenry in an increasingly global economy (Hughes, 2010; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016). 2.3 Growing Trends of STEM Learning Since the early 2000s when Judith Ramaley coined the term STEM (Christenson, 2011), there has been burgeoning research on how to foster such connected learning across STEM content more effectively through innovative tools, curriculum and instructional designs (D. Bell, 2016; R. L. Bell &amp; Lederman, 2003; Breiner et al., 2012; J. Brown, 2012; Capraro et al., 2013; Heil et al., 2013). In order to identify this emerging trend in a holistic and scientific manner, I have conducted a bibliometric analysis (i.e., bibliometrics). Bibliometrics is a method to summarize scientific publications by measuring certain metadata variables with quantitative statistics (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017; Thelwall, 2008). Some typical results that bibliometrics can reveal include: growth of papers by year and citations, rankings of most prolific contributors, authorship patterns, rankings of geographical distribution of authors, rankings of most productive institutions, collaboration among institutions, range and percentage of references per paper, and frequency distribution of subject descriptors (Gireesh et al., 2008; Hung, 2012). As its capability of quantifying a large collection of articles can depict research performance evaluation (e.g., growth; maturity; leading authors; conceptual and intellectual maps; and trends of a scientific community), this method has been increasingly employed by policymakers, university and government labs, research directors and administrators, information specialists and librarians, and scholars (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017). As of 10:37 AM 7/28/2019, a total of 604 articles were retrieved from the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science database (http://www.webofknowledge.com) using the following search query conditions: Search Query: AB=(\"stem education\" OR \"stem learning\") AND LA=\"english\" AND DT=\"article\" Language: English Document Type: Article Timespan: All years Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&amp;HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, BKCI-S, BKCI-SSH, ESCI, CCR-EXPANDED, IC Using an open-source Statistical language environment R [Version 4.1.0; R Core Team (2019)] and bibliometrix package (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017), I have conducted the following three analyses with the collected metadata: (1) Annual scientific growth by year; (2) Country scientific production by authors affiliation; and (3) Conceptual structure with wordcloud and multiple correspondence analysis. As illustrated in Figure 2.1, there have been rising publications in regards to STEM within learning discourse, and this trend, although western countries are dominant, can also be seen globally (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.1: Annual scientific production chart of 604 articles on STEM learning and STEM education. Figure 2.2: Country scientific production chart drawn from authors affiliation information. Figure 2.3, a wordcloud based on Keywords-Plus of each article, illuminates that Science and Math education, in particular, play a central role in STEM education to engage students with high performance in inquiry-based instructions using technology-enhanced design. A conceptual structure map made by multiple correspondence analysis of the most top-20 cited articles with five clusters further depicts this paradigm in detail (see Figure 2.4). While the cluster results are subject to researchers interpretation, I would label them respectively as follows: (1) Inquiry-based learning in higher education; (2) STEM-oriented content components; (3) Curriculum for professional development; (4) Pedagogical relationship between STEM and making (while highlighting equity issues across gender and ethnicity); and (5) Integrated instructional design focusing on collaborative project-based learning experience.

The first is concerned with the viewpoint on STEM educations interconnectedness and complexity in relation to social, cultural, and political ecosystems. The second is about a critical lens on how a disability can be positioned within a society. The final one is the pedagogical framework explaining how socioculturally learning happens within communities of practice. 2.4.1 Ecological Model of STEM Education Among various perceptions of STEM education, this dissertation, in particular, follows the Ecological Model of STEM Education proposed by Basham et al. (2010). Resting upon the four nested ecological model systems (Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1994) have proposed a framework that offers more accessible, relevant, and effective instruction in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to all students (p. 9) as follows. First, the macrosystem speaks to the social and political goals that drive the instructive needs related to STEM. At the foremost worldwide level, STEM instruction activities reflect the interaction of cultural, financial, and social beliefs, and the political objectives that develop from those convictions. Second, exosystem represents the interconnected systems influencing the student; however, any of these systems does not directly interact with the learner yet (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). According to Basham et al. (2010), this is where the state, regional, and community impact on STEM is important (p. 13). Third, mesosystem refers to connections between the systems that impact the student (e.g., the association between the individuals domestic environment, the school, and the exosystem). All of the systems, at this level, directly impact the learner and are linked with one another. Bronfenbrenner (1994) describes the mesosystem as the complex interaction of different microsystems, the fourth model. This crossing point incorporates components for integrating STEM instruction into different situations such as home, school, and work (Basham et al., 2010). And finally, microsystem that is characterized by a focus on the student and the interactions the student has with the environment, peers, teachers, and family (Basham et al., 2010, p. 15). This includes all the connections that are associated specifically with the student as they relate to STEM (Basham et al., 2010). Taken all together, it is not unreasonable to contend that the current STEM education, which is somewhat blurry, should possess complex and nested systems that call for multi-dimensional approaches. 2.4.2 Political/Relational Model of Disability As this dissertation study addresses the relationship between STEM education and visual impairments, a clear perspective on how a disability is defined is required. I rest upon Alison Kafers political/relational model of disability, where disability is viewed as a product of social relations (Kafer, 2013). This perspective is in line with the social model of disability (Oliver, 2013) that distinguishes between an impairment (physical, sensory, and cognitive challenge) and a disability, which describes a form of social exclusion perpetuated against people who have impairments. In the political/relational model of disability, a disability is enacted through structural and environmental factors, not by their impaired bodies (Kafer, 2013; Thomson, 2017). This rejects the medical model of disability which focuses on managing and/or curing the disability until it disappears as much as possible (Hamraie, 2012). Instead of treating disability as dependency or deficit, I take the perspective of disability as social, political, and cultural result (Shakespeare &amp; others, 2006). For instance, in a Deaf community, in which everyone uses sign language, deafness is a source of cultural pride instead of deficit or disability. In a hearing society, on the other hand, hearing impairment is often treated as a disability that requires accommodation through medical intervention (Mankoff et al., 2010; Novak &amp; Sakakeeny, 2020). In a similar vein, blindness may not be perceived as a disability in a society where and when non-visual communications and tools (e.g., Braille and screen readers) are readily accessible. However, visual impairment becomes a critical disability and barrier in a visually extensive environment. Given that many STEM classes are visually standardized, I assume that blind people may face disabilities beyond their impairments in such environments. Throughout the study, I will look into how a disability is perpetuated in STEM learning context against blind people. 2.4.3 Sociocultural Perspective towards Collaborative Shared Cognition As a pedagogical framework, I subscribe to sociocultural perspective that explains learning as a situated and constructive process within social and cultural contexts. Sociocultural perspective is recognized as its fundamental contribution to shared cognition in STEM education where collaboration plays a central role. Sociocultural perspective, although it takes a wide range of forms of variations, is originally based on Vygotskys social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1980). He differentiated his theories from Piagets cognitive constructivism by highlighting social and cultural impact on human learning going beyond biological, physiological, and cognitive development within individual level (see Piaget &amp; Cook, 1952; Vygotsky, 1980). In other words, Vygotsky claims how a person is situated within a society and culture inevitably leads to his/her learning including knowledge and experience as we cannot bracket the individual out of sociocultural value he/she is standing. The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) illustrates well such idea about how imperative social interaction with other peers and experts would be in broadening a learning scope of individuals (Chaiklin, 2003). This social interaction is important in most STEM disciplines in which students develop their working knowledge by directly and indirectly engaging with their peers and experts through collaborative problem-solving practices (R. L. Bell &amp; Lederman, 2003; Capraro et al., 2013; Kaufman et al., 2003; Labov et al., 2010; Tsui, 2007; Zollman, 2012). Subscribing to his emphasis on sociocultural facet of learning, much of learning science research has evolved towards shared learning by meaningfully connecting individuals and deeply considering the impact of social and cultural factors in learning. The most well-known early scholarly work was done by J. S. Brown et al. (1989). Brown and colleagues, in their article, introduced the term Situated Learning that mirrors Vygotskys sociocultural perspective in learning context. They claim traditional didactic education separates between knowing and doing ignoring integral learning cognition of activity and situation. As solutions, knowledge through activity, learning through cognitive apprenticeship, and cognitive apprenticeship and collaborative learning are suggested throughout the piece to situate authentic cognition between know what and know how (J. S. Brown et al., 1989). The apprenticeship-based learning is congruent with experiential learning (Dewey, 2013) and constructionism (Martinez &amp; Stager, 2013; Papert &amp; Harel, 1991) in the sense that they all support learning by doing; that is, the crux of STEM education. In 1991, Lave and Wenger published historical paper concerning participation in learning that offered the early model of communities of practice (see Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). In the paper, Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) is discussed that can be best described from the following lines: A persons intentions to learn are engaged and the meaning of learning is configured through the process of becoming a full participant in a sociocultural practice. (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p. 29) Seven years later, Wenger brought scholarly attention again into the confluence of communities and participation in learning through his another influential study (see Wenger, 1998). The term Communities of Practice (CoP) has been widely popularized and recognized in both formal and informal learning settings since this publication. Extending the early work discussed in the LPP article (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), he discussed how a community, as a collaborative learning environment around a shared domain of interest, fosters an identity of a learner as a member of the community (Wenger, 1998). Their work has an important meaning in STEM-oriented learning environments in which a community (e.g., labs, classes, and teams) continuously witnesses the occurrence of learning when legitimate peripheral participants (newcomers) move towards becoming full participants with a shared identity of the community to which he/she belongs (Halverson &amp; Sheridan, 2014; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Furthermore, this resonates with the current STEM education which by nature seeks knowledge building community (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2006) where transforming school classes to inquiry communities is focused (Hakkarainen et al., 2013, p. 59). In a knowledge building community, shared ideas (i.e., conceptual artifacts) as well as physical objects actively emerge (Hakkarainen et al., 2013). When it comes to meaning negotiation within a community, the Activity Theory (Cole, 1998; Engeström et al., 1999) should also offer us a great insight in the sense that our learning itself can be seen as mediated activities by artifacts, which turns back to the idea that learning is object-oriented within knowledge creation activities where collaboration takes place around them (Hakkarainen et al., 2013, p. 59). 2.5 Three Issues in Current STEM Education: Equity; Inclusivity; and Accessibility Despite the growing importance of STEM literacy (Zollman, 2012) and its promising values for learning (Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016), occupational (Breiner et al., 2012), and economic (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; D. Bell, 2016; Kaku, 2012) benefits, there have been three primary critiques that call for scholarly and practical attention: (1) Equity issue of gendered disparity; (2) Inclusivity issue of ethnic/racial diversity; and (3) Accessibility issue of discriminating dis/abilities. In the following sections, each of these three issues will be covered briefly. 2.5.1 Equity Issue of Gendered Disparity Several scholars have investigated the relationship between STEM disciplines and gender as a predicting factor to see how much gendered equity issue exists in our learning systems. A recent study conducted by Ganley et al. (2018), for example, highlights underrepresented women population in postsecondary STEM majors. Based upon both the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and newly gathered data on students perceptions of college major traits, they reported perceived gender bias against women plays a critical role in predicting the gender balance in college majors with the perception of the major (e.g., math- or science-oriented) being less important (Ganley et al., 2018). This suggests that the society, at macro-system level (Basham et al., 2010; Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1994), should recognize the tacit perceptions of gender discrimination against college major choices. Simlar findings were discovered in STEM faculty ecology. Xu (2008) pointed out that women had a significantly higher likelihood to change positions within academic careers in STEM although the two genders seemed to be equally devoted to their jobs. An academic culture such as research support, advancement opportunities, and free expression of ideas had put barriers providing women fewer opportunities, which in turn led to dissatisfaction with their work (Xu, 2008). Furthermore, as cited in Torres (2012), 16 percent of women were reported to had resigned after three years, which was 4 percent for men. There are a few studies, however, which have explored the interplay between maker toolkits used in STEM-oriented classes and gender participation. According to Buechley et al. (2008), e-textiles, such as the Lilypad Arduino, could engage girls with hands-on coding and engineering activities that typically had held them back from central participation due to male-friendly designs. In a similar vein, but from deeper historical and cultural perspectives, Buchholz et al. (2014) also found that such e-textiles improved girls empowered access to maker learning by overcoming pre-assumptions separating gendered interests and skills. Together, current STEM environments, ranging from curricula, to career paths, and to electronic toolkits, have been primarily designed with males in mind while a small step towards equitable gendered access could make a big difference. 2.5.2 Inclusivity Issue of Ethnic/Racial Diversity On the other hand, many learning scientists have also underscored the importance of cultural aspects and its educational impact on students identity behind instructions, tools, and designs. For instance, Nasir et al. (2014) have posited our learning involves cultural assumptions; thus, using cultural diversity as an educational and research design asset is imperative to foster more inclusive learning environments for all backgrounds. Following this stance, some have attempted to bring culturally-responsive approaches into teaching computing and making settings (Scott et al., 2015); others have further centered on the cultural facets nested within our content creation tools used in STEM classes (Lachney et al., 2016; Richard &amp; Kafai, 2016). Similarly, researchers have found that e-textiles, as mentioned above, can be also utilized to interweave cultural practices with computational skills (Kafai et al., 2014), and this has led to the recently advancing studies such as the bidirectional media design activities tailored for culturally and ethnically diverse youth using seamless integration between a plug-and-play physical electronics (e.g., Lilypad; the MaKeyMaKey( and digital block-based coding environments (e.g., Scratch) (Richard &amp; Giri, 2017; Richard &amp; Kafai, 2015a, 2015b). Richard and colleagues, through their research, have highlighted that using multiple combination of various toolkits with different material affordances fostered for more inclusive collaboration across not only genders, but also diverse cultural background, which was also found effective for a collegiate hardware and software hackathon (Richard et al., 2015). Overall, we can understand that current lerning design as well as content creation tools in STEM education are not value-free in terms of cultural pre-assumption; thus, multi-dimentional approaches, while not prefixing in favor of a certain dominant group, would serve to create new STEM culture welcoming diversity. 2.5.3 Accessibility Issue of Discriminating Dis/Abilities Despite this comprehensive need for STEM literacy, students with disabilities, who have been increasingly participating in regular classrooms with the legislative support for equal access to general education (Rao et al., 2014; K. D. Roberts et al., 2011), experience significant difficulties in STEM (Israel et al., 2013). Students with disabilities continuously perform below their peers without disabilities on standardized measures in STEM subjects (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Hwang &amp; Taylor, 2016; Israel et al., 2013), and often fall behind in STEM content since middle school (Israel et al., 2013; Marino, 2010). This disengagement has led to rare presence of those with disabilities in STEM workforce as only about 5 percent of students with disabilities enter the STEM careers (Leddy, 2010). However, a few studies have pointed out the struggles come primarily from the dearth of accessible teaching materials, inclusive curricula, and experiences of instructors teaching student with disabilities; rather than students disabilities themselves (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Martin et al., 2011; Thurston et al., 2017). Martin et al. (2011) argue, In order to be afforded equal opportunity, especially in STEM fields, people with disabilities must be able to work their way through multiple barriers (p. 295). This implies that more inclusive STEM materials and scaffolding learning designs are imperative for students with disabilities to fully engage with STEM content before leaving them taking all responsibilities for the STEM frustration (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Samsonov et al., 2006; Thurston et al., 2017). 2.5.3.1 Challenges of Blind Learners in STEM Education While each individual with disabilities still lacks accessible STEM curricula, blind students, in particular, experience extra challenges and have become even more disenfranchised with STEM subjects (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Cryer, 2013; Edwards et al., 2006; Gardner, 2002; Jones et al., 2006; Supalo et al., 2006). According to American Printing House for the Blind (2017), there are approximately 63,657 U.S. children, youth, and adult students in educational settings (between the age of 0 and 21) who are legally blind (i.e., those with central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, or visual field of 20 degrees or less). Globally, there are approximately 1.3 billion people with some varying degree of visual impairments, and 36 million of whom are blind (i.e., visual acuity worse than 3/60, World Health Organization, 2018). These people have faced consistantly the following issues when engaged with STEM content. First, material accessibility issue. As STEM materials and curricula are designed in the ways of heavily relying on visual model, those who cannot employ visual sense for their learning encounter rudimentary barriers in accessing such information unlike sighted counterparts (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Cryer, 2013). Second, instructional inclusivity issue. Teachers and instructors in general education system are often unfamiliar with non-visual teaching methods for STEM content, which keeps unintentionally marginalizing their blind students in classes (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Fraser &amp; Maguvhe, 2008; Gardner, 2002). Third, networking issue. As blind students have increasingly become integrated into regular classrooms with the support of legislation advocating for equal access for all (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act, 1997, 2004; Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990; Sections 504 (1973) and 508 (1998) of the Rehabilitation Act), they are frequently the only non-visual learner in classes. In other words, they lack natural opportunities to meet blind peers or adults who can possibly serve as role models to inspire them to develop confidence in STEM subjects (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Finally, low social and self- expectation issue. Teachers, parents, and blind students themselves do not hold high expectation towards success in STEM areas as being blind (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Martin et al., 2011). Although there have been many challenges for blind students to engage in STEM education, some scholars demonstrated that these issues may be the matter of sociotechnical accessibility (Lundgard et al., 2019) rather than students visual disabilities. In other words, when accessible tools are introduced in an appropriate manner, it is likely that students with visual impairments can find some potential interests in STEM regardless of their visual challenges. For example, Seo &amp; Richard (2018) have conducted an exploratory study tailored for high school students with visual impairments and young adult (aged between 14 through 20) utilizing a wooden block-based physical robot platform called Kibo. They found, while a small modification (e.g., attaching Braille labels; using audible output modules) could improve not only blind individuals interest in computer programming, but also group cognition and their computational thinking (Seo &amp; Richard, 2018). Similarly, instead of visual disabilities, less tangible bread board design in electronic kits (e.g., Arduino; Raspberry PI), inaccessible maker toolkits instruction documents for assistive technology, and a lack of multi-sensory modules have been pointed out as three critical challenges of engaging blind individuals into a tinkering culture which is the virtue of STEM-focused disciplines (Seo, 2018, 2019). Taken together, it can be assumed that blind people have especially been excluded in STEM learning cultures due in part to its visually extensive and inaccessible sociotechnical systems, not just because of their visual impairments or level of (dis)abilities. 2.6 Overview of Computer-Assisted Text Analysis This section will explain about some methodological backgrounds that this study will rest upon by focusing on computer-assisted text analysis. Over the years, content analysis has been widely used in various social science disciplines to examine patterns within communication artifacts in a systematic and replicable fashion. As opposed to traditional methods of qualitative research, which have been often criticized by postpositivists for its vague reliability and validity, content analysts have attempted to actively address such issues using the following techniques (Nelson, 2017): (1) Developing a coding scheme (i.e., codebook) based upon researchers expertise and established theories through iterative phases that can be used as a reasonable basis to categorize given data for internal validity. (2) Coding consistently according to the developed code reference throughout each of researchers analytical processes for within-researcher reliability. (3) Testing inter-rater reliability coefficients (e.g., Cohens \\(\\kappa\\); Krippendorffs \\(\\alpha\\)) to ensure statistically valid agreements between different coders on assigned labels (i.e., codes) across each segmented unit of analysis for between-researcher reliability (J. Cohen, 1960; Jacob Cohen, 1968; Conger, 1980; Fleiss et al., 1969; Fleiss, 1971; Krippendorff, 2018; Light, 1971). (4) Detailing each step of data processing and analytical strategies transparently to make sure other researchers can reproduce the full analysis for external validity. Despite its ideal methodological rigor, on the other hand, there exist certain problems with the use of conventional hand-coding content analysis (Nelson, 2017). First, generating coding categories is limited to researchers pre-assumed knowledge, which may or may not capture hidden patterns out of target complex communication texts. Thus, to what extent a subjectively-developed coding scheme can explain underlying patterns within data (internal validity) can remain in the researchers black box. Second, either within- or between-researcher reliability, or both can be unstable. For a human rater, Consistently coding the same text in the same way several times is very difficult due to fatigue, emotion, and other environmental factors. Furthermore, it is even more challenging for different individuals to steadily agree on coding processes over a long transcript. Third, study replicability (i.e., external validity) is not realistically secured. Repeatedly-trained coding results, in favor of a person holding more powerful authority, until team members reach a certain level of reliability coenfficient make it often difficult for other researchers to reproduce the same analysis. Finally, due to the time-consuming nature of hand-coding procedures, the traditional content analysis cannot deal with large corpora of texts exceeding human-manageable amount, which unintentionally leaves out other available data holding value of discovery. Computer-assisted text analysis has emerged to address these issues with the growing advances in computing power and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. While there have been some scholarly debates revolving around what specific combination of methods and algorithms can offer social scientists the best meaningful patterns from text data (Bail, 2014; Biernacki, 2012, 2015; DiMaggio et al., 2013; Lee &amp; Martin, 2015; Nelson, 2017; Reed, 2015), it is commonly agreed that using computer-assisted content analysis can be more efficient than hand-coding analysis alone in terms of the capability to process any size of data in more consistent, scalable, and less timelier ways (Grimmer &amp; King, 2011; Hillard et al., 2008; Lowe &amp; Benoit, 2013; Reich et al., 2015). Moreover, as cited in Reich et al. (2015), some experimental studies have provided scientific evidence to computer-automated text clusters can be more semantically coherent than even a taxonomy created by the documents authors (p. 158) (Grimmer &amp; King, 2011; Grimmer &amp; Stewart, 2013), which has increasingly attracted many social scientists interests in applying computational text analysis to their disciplines including political science (Grimmer, 2010; King et al., 2013; Schwartz &amp; Ungar, 2015), sociology (Bohr &amp; Dunlap, 2018; Chakrabarti &amp; Frye, 2017; Nelson, 2017; Nelson et al., 2018), psychology (Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010; Yu &amp; Ho, 2014), and education (Anaya &amp; Boticario, 2011; Reich et al., 2015). Computer-assisted text analysis is typically carried out using machine learning, which is defined as a general field in computer science that seeks to develop ways for computers to learn without being explicitly programmed (Nelson, 2017, p. 8), and it can take either of two forms: supervised text classification or unsupervised text clustering. In what follows, I will briefly introduce the two different types of computer-assisted text analysis. 2.6.1 Deductive Text Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning The first flavor of computer-assisted text analysis is using supervised machine learning algorithms to classify text into predefined categories. Just as in conventional content analysis of text done by hand, researchers need to manually prepare for some complete dataset (i.e., training data) that contains pairs of text as inputs and their each corresponding codes (i.e., labels) as outputs. Based on the training data created by humans as a supervisor, computational analysis is carried out to elicit parameters for classifying the rest of the data to predict how humans would have labelled them (Reich et al., 2015). In summary, supervised machine learning is utilized when categorizing texts into existing coding schemes deductively to overcome some limitations of hand-coding conventions as pointed out above. However, supervised machine learning comes at cost of a non-trivial number of efforts including manually-coded train, validation, and test datasets, which encourages researchers to look into more automated methods (Nelson et al., 2018). 2.6.2 Inductive Text Clustering Using Unsupervised Machine Learning The second form of computer-assisted text analysis is using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to automatically and inductively cluster text into computationally-derived themes without any predetermined labels (Nelson, 2017; Reich et al., 2015). Unlike either hand-coding or supervised content analysis, this type of methods does not require user input besides raw data along with the number of desired output clusters (denoted with K), from which parameters of interest are derived (Reich et al., 2015, p. 159). Drawing upon syntactic features in a corpus (e.g., word co-occurrence), computers first identify patterns within and across texts, which are then further examined by humans for its substantial meaning in the line of text content and structure (Reich et al., 2015), and it often proves to have semantically meaningful correlates (Reich et al., 2015, p. 159). One of the well-established unsupervised methods is probabilistic topic modeling (Blei, 2012). Based on the co-occurrence of words in the document corpus and repeated sampling methods, probabilistic topic models simultaneously estimate topics and assign topic weights to each document (Nelson et al., 2018, p. 21). To put it another way, probabilistic topic models treats each document as a mixture of topics (denoted with either \\(\\gamma\\) or \\(\\theta\\) probability), and each topic as a mixture of words (denoted with \\(\\beta\\) probability) (see Blei, 2012; Grimmer, 2010; Grimmer &amp; King, 2011; M. E. Roberts et al., 2013). Using these calculated and featured topical proportion, therefore, researchers can estimate general semantic themes within a corpus of documents (Blei, 2012; Reich et al., 2015). The following description by Reich et al. (2015) further explains how topic modeling can support human reading of large corpora of texts: Topic models use the patterns of word co-occurrences to infer semantic relationships. Loosely speaking, if two words frequently co-occur across many of the documents, we infer that they reference a similar concept or theme. The topics themselves are distributions over words. For example, consider an assignment where students write a paragraph about what they do in a typical day. One topic might be about learning, and give high probability to words such as learning, homework, class, but low probability to words such as cooking or eating. Each document exhibits a mixture over the topics, which encode the proportion of words within the document that the software estimates to have come from each topic. The semantic themes uncovered by the model provide a useful structure for summarizing large sets of documents. These methods complement human reading by organizing the unstructured corpus. Topic models have been widely applied throughout the social sciences and digital humanities (see Blei, 2012, and references therein). (p. 159) The following description is also instrumental for those who new to topic modeling: Briefly, the intuition behind topic modeling is that each document in a corpus is produced or structured from a set number of topics. Topic modeling algorithms analyze the co-occurrence of words within a document over a large number of documents to, in effect, reverse engineer these topics from the larger corpus. More practically, topic modeling algorithms . . . . serve to reduce a complicated corpus to simpler, interpretable, groups of words. The output of a topic modeling algorithm is lists of weighted words, where each list is a topic and where higher weighted words in a list are more indicative of that topic, and it represents each document as a distribution over topics, which can be used to detect thematic patterns across documents. (Nelson, 2017, pp. 1415) There exist many algorithms available for topic modeling including, but not limited to, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation [LDA; Blei et al. (2003)], the most basic topic model method; the Correlated Topic Model [CTM; Blei &amp; Lafferty (2007)], the hierarchical model of document collections based on LDA; and the Structural Topic Model [STM; M. E. Roberts et al. (2013)], the similar algorithm to CTM but having an added capability to estimate a topic model with document-level metadata as covariates. For this dissertation, I employ the STM algorithm, in particular, which will be described in the following section for its benefits. 2.6.3 Abductive Text Interpretation Using Structural Topic modeling Although unsupervised topic modeling can alleviate laborious work of either hand-coding or supervised machine learning content analysis, it cannot be perfect alone without humans explicit and iterative interpretation (Nelson, 2017; Nelson et al., 2018; M. E. Roberts et al., 2013). In other words, automated results calculated by any computer algorithms is subject to a humans critical scrutiny, and the abductive interaction between computer algorithms and human interpretation is required for meaningful discovery out of a large corpus of texts. Unlike other topic models, the STM algorithm provides social scientists, who deal with complex sociocultural phenomena, with some advanced features supporting for human-centered meaning discovery going beyond being passive to automated results. One of the distinctive capabilities is that researchers can consider the effects of covariates (e.g., information about the author or document; year; gender) on their estimated topic models (i.e., themes) by incorporating document-level metadata into their model just as in formulating a linear regression model (Reich et al., 2015). Hence, researchers can leverage this existing information [the covariates] and facilitate accurate inferences for how the observed variables relate to the latent topics (Reich et al., 2015, p. 161). The STM algorithm has been developed in and for open-source statistical R language (R Core Team, 2019; M. Roberts et al., 2019), and the package developers describe its four key affordances as follows (Reich et al., 2015, p. 161): Estimated topics, including a small set of label words most indicative of that topic and archetypal documents from each topic. Relationships between covariates and topics. The prevalence of each topic throughout the corpus along with documents most heavily focused on each topic. Correlation patterns between topics (i.e., which topics are most likely to occur together within a document). Since the package provides users with a wide range of features such as text pre-processor, data transformation, estimation for the likelihood of a held-out test, visualization and evaluation of each exploratory procedure fitting topic models [see Figure 2.5 for its detailed workflow; M. Roberts et al. (2019)], researchers can preserve the superior abilities [of humanistic insights] to interpret text holistically while benefitting from the formal rigor, reliability, and reproducibility of computer-assisted methods (Nelson, 2017, p. 6). With its versatile applicability for large unstructured textual data, in fact, recently there have been a growing body of research in social science disciplines using the STM algorithm (Bohr &amp; Dunlap, 2018; Chakrabarti &amp; Frye, 2017; Grajzl, 2019; Mishler, 2015; Nelson et al., 2018; Reich et al., 2015; M. E. Roberts et al., 2013; see Tvinnereim et al., 2017). Given the study purpose that aims at uncovering informal STEM learning cultures of blind people and its data involving large corpora of texts which cannot be read by humans in a reasonable timeframe (see Chapter 1.3), I employ the STM package (M. Roberts et al., 2019) throughout this dissertation study to abductively explore both topical prevalence (how often a topic is discussed) and topical content (the words used in discussing a topic) (Reich et al., 2015; M. E. Roberts et al., 2013). Figure 2.5: Heuristic description of generative process and estimation of the STM (adapted from M. E. Roberts et al., 2014, p. 4). 2.7 Chapter Summary This chapter introduced some undergirding literature, theoretical frameworks, and methodological backgrounds for this study. While STEM education has become more prevalent across formal and informal learning, it also possesses some unexplored areas that need both scholarly and practical attention. Taking political/relational model of disability (Kafer, 2013), I see STEM education as Ecological Model (Basham et al., 2010), in which individuals with visual impairmentes or blindness are politically, socially, and culturally situated with four dimensional intersection (i.e., macro-; exo-; meso-; and microsystem). Resting upon sociocultural learning [Vygotsky (1980); ] as well as communities of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), I will explore how blind people are socioculturally situated within current STEM learning systems as captured through a large-scale textual corpus. To conduct this research, I will employ computer-assisted content analysis in general, and utilize structural topic model as an abductive approach (M. E. Roberts et al., 2013).

At the outset, I will cover research design this study adopts from both technical and methodological perspectives. I will then explain in detail how I attempted to address ethical concerns in following procedures. Next, I will outline a set of research questions that this study aims to answer. I will also describe the study settings and samples, and my unique positionality within this research. Finally, this chapter will talk about how data were collected and analyzed. 3.2 Research Design The overall design of this mixed methods research subscribes to the concept of computational ethnography (Abramson et al., 2018). Traditionally, ethnography is often defined as a qualitative approach focused in depth on a shared culture or a bounded group of people, usually based on contextual data immersion such as participant-observation, interviews, and micro-level archival research (Griffin &amp; Bengry-Howell, 2007). However, as Abramson et al. (2018) argue, social scientists conducting ethnography encounter challenges concerned with internal and external validity, generalization, reliability, and bias (Goldthorpe, 2000; King et al., 1994; Sánchez-Jankowski, 2002). Such challenges lead to a tripartite criticism which frames ethnography as an exploratory, anecdotal, and opaque method that is less scientific than quantitative alternatives (Abramson et al., 2018, p. 258, emphasis added). Computational ethnography extends ethnographys conventional qualitative scope by employing data-driven computational methods that can help address the common critiques of ethnography with enhanced scalability, replicability, and transparency (Abramson et al., 2018). It continues to embrace the strength of qualitative ethnography to comprehend the shared cultures of people who give that data meaning, while holding a participatory lens on how larger systems, such as norms, values, assumptions, are culturally, historically and politically encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical data-driven systems (Abramson et al., 2018; Abramson &amp; Dohan, 2015; Dohan &amp; Sanchez-Jankowski, 1998; Moore et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2015). Computational ethnography, as an emerging mixed method, often applies exploratory data science techniques (e.g., descriptive analysis; clustering analysis; social network analysis; relational analysis) to a large-scale (or more, big data sized) corpora of texts to help researchers uncover meaningful patterns of the target data in the least intrusive fashion which would otherwise be infeasible to analyze with conventional qualitative approaches (Abramson et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2015). Typical computational ethnography study first involves descriptive and syntactical pattern discovery assisted by computer algorithms, then is followed by researchers deep interpretation of the detected patterns to relate it to semantical explanation. This mixed-method interaction between data-driven computation and context-driven interpretation iteratively contributes to one another until a comprehensive understanding of the data is saturated (Abramson et al., 2018; Nelson et al., 2018). As described in Chapter 1.3, the purpose of this study is to discover collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing STEM disciplines as captured through computer-mediated mailing listservs. Given that such online communications are often saved as large-scale archived knowledge, computational ethnography is a well-suited methodological approach that can bring scalable benefit to observe the longitudinal cultural heritage of blind people. On top of the computer-assisted data exploration on the large-scale archived online data, this research also conducts small-scale semi-structured interviews with few blind learners pursuing STEM disciplines to enrich understanding of the discovered patterns. As such, from a mixed-method research design perspective, this study also aligns with what Creswell (2015) categorizes as a convergent design which is defined as follows: The intent of a convergent design is to merge the results of the quantitative and qualitative data analyses. This merging then provides both a quantitative and a qualitative picture of the problem, and because both forms of data provide different insight, their combination contributes to seeing the problem from multiple angles and multiple perspectives. In short, quantitative results yield general trends and relationships, which are often needed, while qualitative results provide in-depth personal perspectives of individuals. Both are useful results, and their combination adds up to not only more data, but also a more complete understanding than what would have been provided by each database alone. (Creswell, 2015, pp. 3536) 3.3 Research Ethics and Procedures This computational ethnography has been carefully carried out with appropriate ethics following the typical five procedures of ethnographic study (Griffin &amp; Bengry-Howell, 2007). Gaining Access The foremost important step is to gain an official access to the target community. Although the primary data of this research is in the public domain, I passed through all the possible ethical review processes across the Pennsylvania State University as well as internal to the NFB (Table 3.1). This way secured me a safer position while protecting the vulnerable community before obtaining and analyzing mailing lists. As of May 21 2019, the Office for the Research Protections of the university determined the proposed study, entitled Exploring Knowledge Sharing and Online Interactions in the Public Mailing Lists for Blind People, as Not Human Research category, and the follow-up interview protocol was exempted on December 19 2019 (Appendix A). As a double-checking process to address any unexpected ethical issues at a community level, on the other hand, I have also contacted gatekeepers of the NFB organization and was officially permitted by the NFB Research Advisory Council to conduct this study (see Appendix B). Table 3.1: Ethical review for this study. Date Committee Subject Determination 2019-05-21 Office for Research Protections at the Pennsylvania State University Exploring Knowledge Sharing and Online Interactions in the Public Mailing Lists for Blind People Non-human research: Study #00012478 2019-12-19 Office for Research Protections at the Pennsylvania State University Follow-Up Interview: Exploring Knowledge Sharing and Online Interactions in the Public Mailing Lists for Blind People Exempt research: Study #00014119 2020-01-10 NFB Research Advisory Council NFB Research Participant Solicitation Request Form Approved 2020-01-22 Office of the NFB President Permission Request for Using the NFB Email Archives for Research Purposes Approved Introducing to the Community After gaining access to the community, I sent an official email to the NFB mailing listservs to introduce myself and the purpose of this study to the subscribers. I also highlighted that this study would be performed in a way that does not disclose their personal information using aggregated data science techniques. However, I asked if anyone wanted to opt out so that I could remove their data before I dived into data analysis. Nobody expressed any rejection or willingness to opt out. Thus, I accepted it as a tacit agreement and included all the archived email communications for my computational observation process. Participant Observation The participant-observation was conducted using archived data of the target NFB listservs. Typically there are two approaches in terms of participant-observation: overt vs. covert (Griffin &amp; Bengry-Howell, 2007). While an overt approach discloses researchers identity to the members of the group being studied, a covert approach hides researchers intent to the community to conduct the study in the least intrusive manner. Computational ethnography with archived data provides researchers with a unique position. As it is derived from past data that already happened, I did not need to be concerned about the dichotomy (i.e., overt vs. covert approaches). Instead, I could benefit from the temporality that archived data offered which enabled me to vividly observe and backtrace the phenomena. Chapter 3.7.1 and 3.8 detail how I performed the participant-observation using computational approaches. Working with Informants I recruited eight blind members of the target NFB listservs who could inform me of the community culture and study topics. Chapter 3.7.2 details the procedure that I went through for this interaction (see also, Appendix C and Appendix D). Sharing Findings with the Community This is the final procedure to complete this ethnographic study. As this research involves various data science results along with text descriptions, I write this dissertation in multi-formatted outputs including Word (docx) and web (html) files so that the blind community can find the study details in accessible ways following their needs. For some data visualization results, I use the SAS Graphics Accelerator (SAS Accessibility Team, n.d.) to produce accessible audio charts and tables for the blind community to alternatively consume the information. 3.4 Research Questions This study seeks to answer the following research questions. Primary RQ: What are the sociocultural characteristics of collective knowledge-sharing patterns produced by blind learners pursuing STEM disciplines? The primary research question can be broken down into several sub-questions which are listed below: 3.4.1 Quantitative Research Questions Firstly, as a bird-eye view approach, the following data-driven research questions are explored in order to guide the overall question systematically. 3.4.1.1 Descriptive Questions Quan RQ1.1: What are the frequency and variation patterns of collective knowledge participations of members in the target mailing listservs between January 2009 and December 2019? Quan RQ1.2: What are the top-10 most participated topics among members found in the target online listservs? Quan RQ1.3: What are the most salient words in each of the four target listservs? 3.4.1.2 Semantic Network Questions Quan RQ2: What are the semantic network patterns found in each of the four target listservs? Quan RQ2.1: What are the most common co-occurring words in each mailing list? Quan RQ2.2: What are the most correlated words in each mailing list? Quan RQ2.3: What are the most common bigrams (a pair of two words) in each mailing list? 3.4.1.3 Data Clustering Questions Quan RQ3.1: What are estimated latent topics across all of the four target mailing lists calculated by Structural Topic Models? (simply stated, What kinds of conversations are provoked across all of the four NFB mailing lists?) Quan RQ3.2: In what ways are the estimated structural topics correlated with each other? Quan RQ3.3: How does the rate of topics (i.e., topical prevalence) change over time? Quan RQ3.4: How do these topical distributions (detected from RQ3.1) vary by the four types of the NFB mailing lists? Quan RQ3.5: How do the detected topical distributions vary by the type of mailing lists over time? 3.4.2 Qualitative Research Questions Secondly, the following research questions are addressed based on the semi-structured interviews with the members (i.e., informants) of the NFB STEM-oriented mailing lists. Qual RQ1: What are the common STEM-related issues of blind learners? Qual RQ2: What strategies are utilized by blind individuals to pursue STEM disciplines 3.4.3 Hybrid Mixed Methods Question At the end, the following research question is answered by combining the quantitative and qualitative research findings. Mixed RQ: What results emerge from comparing the qualitative interviews about the STEM-learning experiences of blind individuals with the computational outcomes derived from the STEM-oriented listservs? 3.5 Setting and Sample The complete (i.e., ideal) population pool of this research is blind people who cannot (either completely or partially) employ their functional visions for learning STEM content. While there is no internationally agreed definition on blindness, this study has used the statutory definition of legally blind, those who have a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, or a visual field of 20 degrees or less (as cited in American Printing House for the Blind, 2017). In order to access this population more realistically, a purposeful convenience sampling strategy has been used, and the National Federation of the Blind (n.d.) has been selected as a primary target community. The National Federation of the Blind is the oldest and largest organization led by blind people in the United States founded in 1940, and currently headquartered in Baltimore. The NFB has affiliates, chapters, and divisions in all fifty states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Through their wide network of blind members, the NFB runs various programs, services, and resources (e.g., teaching Braille; organizing STEM membership programs; supporting assistive technology design and development) to advocate for the rights of blind people, provide information and support to blind children and adults, and build a community that creates more opportunities for blind individuals. The NFB has their clear philosophy of blindness as follows: The National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or your future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams. You can live the life you want; blindness is not what holds you back. (National Federation of the Blind, n.d.) While the NFB orchestrates many physical events, it also provides more than 257 online mailing listservs where members of the NFB can exchange ideas with each other on various topics. All the email communication is archived in the public domain on the NFB website (National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists, n.d.). As such, the primary setting of this study is online, including the archive analysis as well as follow-up Zoom interviews. 3.6 Positionality I, as a blind individual myself, have been a local chapter (aka, Happy Valley) member of the NFB in Pennsylvania for about seven years since 2014, and also have subscribed to most of the target mailing listservs for more than five years. The only exception is the Artists-Making-Art because I found the existence of this listserv while preparing for this study. My double identity as a blind researcher and a member of the NFB naturally leads to a deep understanding of the study context and permits a strong reflexivity on the study findings and implications. 3.7 Data Collection The data collection of this study comes from two sources (1) large-scale textual archives produced by the NFB community members for computational participant-observation; and (2) small-scale semi-structured interviews from the community informants for in-depth interpretation. 3.7.1 Computational Participant-Observation To conduct data-driven participant-observation, longitudinal text data that contains members textual communication between January 2009 and December 2019 has been obtained by the publicly downloadable mailing list archives on their website [National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists (n.d.); https://www.nfbnet.org/mailman/listinfo]. Among 257 active mailing lists, the following four STEM-oriented archives have been included for this research (Table 3.2: (1) Science and Engineering; (2) Computer Science; (3) Artists-Making-Art; and (4) BlindMath . All personally identifiable information (e.g., names; email addresses; email signature lines; and other sensitive or private portions) have been systematically either removed or replaced with pseudonyms for the data analyses and report procedures.

As a result of the recruitment (Appendix C.1), eight individuals participated in the Zoom interview. Table 3.3 includes some demographic information of the participants.

Full description on each column can be found in Appendix C.3. The interview took place between February 2020 and December 2020, and each of the eight interviews was carried out on Zoom Conference platform due to its great accessibility features for screen readers. Each session lasted approximately an hour following carefully prepared semi-structured interview protocol, which included few questions about their visual impairments, learning experiences in STEM subjects, experience with the NFB mailing lists, and demographic information (see Appendix C.3). With the participants consent, all the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for further analysis (Appendix D includes interview transcripts). 3.8 Data Analysis Procedure The analytical procedure of this study is based upon Knowledge Discovery in Textual Databases (KDT) model (Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995). The KDT model involves the process of extracting meaningful, non-trivial patterns or knowledge from a set of unstructured texts (Hung, 2012, p. 4). As an extension of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD, U. M. Fayyad et al., 1996), text data mining (Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995) is typically conducted in the five procedures: (1) data extraction; (2) data cleaning; (3) data transformation; (4) text mining; and (5) results evaluation and interpretation. The first three phases involve data preprocessing; the latter (4 and 5) requires human-centered analysis and evaluation of text mining algorithms, which leads to an iterative cycle until a meaningful discovery is sufficiently saturated (U. Fayyad et al., 1996; Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995; Hung, 2012). In addition to the KDT model, three-step Computational Grounded Theory (Nelson, 2017) has also been combined as a check-point framework to make sure the quality of detected text patterns (see Figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: An analytical procedure chart following the five phases of Knowledge Discovery in Textual Databases (Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995) combined with Computational Grounded Theory (Nelson, 2017). Data management and analysis have been performed using statistical computing language R [Version 4.1.0; R Core Team (2019)] environment and required packages. All coding process employed for this research is provided as supplemental material (see Appendix E; Appendix G; Appendix I) subscribing to the recent trend of reproducible research to demystify computer-assisted text analysis and enhance its reliability (H. E. Brown, 2013; Nelson, 2017; Nelson et al., 2018). The subsections below outline each step of the data analysis following the KDT procedure. 3.8.1 Phase I: Data Extraction The first phase of the KDT model is preparing for data to analyze. As described in Chapter 3.7, this research focuses on the four STEM-oriented mailing list archives between January 2009 and December 2019 (see Table 3.2). The following criteria has been implemented for choosing these four mailing lists: The list topic must be closely related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects.1 The list must have a sufficient history (at least 8 to 10 years) to play a role in capturing longitudinal STEM activities of blind people including their challenges and solutions. The list must have a sufficient number of memberships (at least 50). The list communication must be done in English. Although the National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists (n.d.) allows anyone with a modern Internet browser to manually download their public mailing archives in a zipped (i.e., gzip) format, I used Unix shell commands instead to extract the target archive files in a systematic and replicable fashion (see Appendix E). No robots exclusion protocol (i.e., robots.txt) that defines the allowed level of web crawling has been found in the site root. This implies any search engine can parse each content tree available on this site (Drott, 2002), which in turn justifies using shell commands to crawl these public archives. At the end of this initial stage, I was able to retrieve all required target archives from the National Federation of the Blind Mailing Lists (n.d.) website and extract them as an mbox format. Mbox is a plain-text file type that holds concatenated email messages. 3.8.2 Phase II and III: Data Cleaning and Transformation The second (Data Cleaning) and third (Data Transformation) steps are carried out simultaneously until a researcher finds the transformed data good to proceed towards actual analysis. Ideal data shape through these steps would take tidy data structure (Wickham &amp; others, 2014) in which rows correspond to individual observations (i.e., samples), and columns represent variables (also known as either features or attributes). To complete this goal, I developed an R package, called mboxr (Seo &amp; Choi, 2019), which takes mbox-formatted file(s) as an input and converts it into a structured data as its output in a tidy form (also called tibble in R environment, Müller &amp; Wickham, 2019). Since mboxr package (Seo &amp; Choi, 2019) has been published in the peer-reviewed Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; https://cran.r-project.org/), its stability has been validated by other computational statisticians to some reliable degree. Furthermore, the package has been under active development at GitHub repository (https://github.com/jooyoungseo/mboxr); thus, the source code of this package is transparently available to analyze. In light of the seamless nature between data cleaning and transformation, the following were undertaken together at this stage: Cleaning the mbox files extracted through the previous stage (Chapter 3.8.1). As some mbox files retrieved had to be fixed for non-escaped issues for a new line starting with From in message body, I addressed this problem by replacing From with &gt;From following the standard email message protocols (see Appendix G). Transforming mbox files into a tibble format [the tidy data structure used in R; Wickham &amp; others (2014)] using mboxr package (Seo &amp; Choi, 2019). Removing the unnecessary prefix from subject fields of each archive. Since each mailing archive has a unique prefix within their subject lines (e.g., NFB-CS; NFB-Science; Arts-Making; BlindMath respectively), it needed to be taken them out to help the next text mining phase to uncover more pronounced results. At the end of this process, the mbox files obtained in the previous section had been transformed into a large data frame with one-message-per-row structure along with 11 variables (see Table 3.4 for the sample dataset), and a total of 24858 messages (2099 messages from Science &amp; Engineering; 13199 NFB in Computer Science; 382 Artists-Making-Art; 9178 BlindMath) had been ready for analysis. Consult with Appendix G to learn about how to reproduce this stage in detail. Table 3.4: A structured sample of email texts.

At this stage, I performed the following three analyses that respond to each of the quantitative research questions (Chapter 1.4.1): First, descriptive statistics (i.e., counting and central tendency analysis) were performed to systematically capture the frequency and variation of message exchange patterns within each listserv over time. Through this initial analysis, the research questions under Chapter 1.4.1.1 were answered by counting the frequency of each categorical variables (i.e., message_ID; from; subject; num_discussants [as a covariate] columns) out of the 11 available features. Second, semantic network analysis had been carried out to elicit the linguistic patterns among subscribers within each listserv. Through this analysis, the research questions in Chapter 1.4.1.2 were examined with co-occurrence; Karl Pearsons \\(\\phi\\) correlation; and bigram network analysis respectively. Finally, structural topic modeling (M. E. Roberts et al., 2013)  one of the natural language processing algorithms that probabilistically discovers latent structural topics within a large corpus of documents  had been employed to identify common themes within the four mailing list archives. Through this analysis, the data clustering questions (Chapter 1.4.1.3) were addressed using content variable as a text input coupled with some document-level metadata as covariates (i.e., mailing_list_type; date; num_discussants). In order to systematically perform human-centered text mining analysis, I followed the three-step methodological framework called computational grounded theory proposed by Nelson (2017) that by definition combines expert human knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content analysis (p. 1). A standard workflow for the framework proceeds as follows: (1) pattern detection; (2) pattern refinement; and (3) pattern confirmation. The following details each step tailored for this study (see Appendix I for reproducible scripts for this text mining section). 3.8.3.1 Step 1: Pattern Detection The first step involves using unsupervised machine learning techniques to inductively explore novel patterns in a large collection of texts (Nelson, 2017). To reduce complicated corpus to interpretable groups of words, probabilistic topic modeling algorithms (Chapter 2.6.2) were utilized to cluster documents to syntactically correlated topics of words. Among various unsupervised topic modeling algorithms, the Structural Topic Model [STM; M. Roberts et al. (2019)] had been employed for this study as detailed in Chapter 2.6.3 for its investigative benefits including the estimation capability of topic models with document-level metadata as covariates. Fitting a basic Structural Topic Model requires the following components: Structured data frame containing both document texts and each corresponding meta data. These were prepared from the phase II (Data Cleaning and Transformation; Chapter 3.8.2) as a tidy data form called tibble just like Table 3.4. In the table with 11 variables, content field was employed for document text input; the remaining attributes for metadata. I created a new covariate list that defined what category of STEM a document belongs to. For example, the new categorical variable, list, have four levels (Science_Eng for NFB-Science; Technology for NFB-CS; Arts for Arts-Making; and Math for BlindMath respectively). More detailed examples on how to formulate hypotheses using document-level metadata is described in the next section 3.8.3.2. The number of desired topics (denoted with K) to cluster documents within a corpus. As mentioned in Chapter 2.6.2, this parameter is used to control the granularity of the requested summary (Reich et al., 2015). Although the K value, in the computer science field, is commonly set by maximizing the predictive power of the model on a heldout sample (Mimno et al., 2011; Reich et al., 2015, p. 164), some research highlight such methodology may not always lead to the most useful and interpretable model (Chang et al., 2009). Hence, the choice of K, on substantive grounds, should be made by comparing several values to reflect the best granularity of the corpus summary (Reich et al., 2015). Taken both structured text input and the number of topics all together, a parametric (i.e., probabilistic) topic model was defined by the STM algorithm based upon Bayesian inference and the posterior distribution (Reich et al., 2015; M. Roberts et al., 2019). 3.8.3.2 Step 2: Pattern Refinement The second step involves an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data (Nelson, 2017, p. 1). Whereas the prior step remains in syntactic pattern recognition calculated by computer algorithms; this stage more concerns semantic pattern interpretation from humanistic deep reading of the texts. However, there is continuity between the step 1 and 2. To result in coherent relationship between such syntactic and semantic patterns, the STM package functions (e.g., stm::cloud() and stm::plot.findThoughts()), which plot most representative documents for a particular topic, were employed to get a better sense of the content of actual documents with a high topical content (M. Roberts et al., 2019). Another refinement that was carried out at this stage was formulating hypotheses. As noted in Chapter 3.8.3.1, there were some document-level metadata (e.g., date; num_discussants; and list field) that could be used as covariates to estimate a topic model. After a topic model had been established to a satisfactory level with content field being text input, such metadata covariates were used in the estimation of topic prevalence (how often a topic is discussed)\" and topical content (the words used in discussing a topic) (Reich et al., 2015, p. 161). Two hypotheses used for the pattern refinement included: The topical distributions (detected from step 1) vary by the type of mailing lists and the number of discussants over time. Kinds of conversations are provoked differently by the type of mailing lists. With such metadata covariates added, the topic model was re-estimated to offer richer contextual information. Consequently, at the end of this step 2, a more holistic interpretation of the data was made by incorporating both syntactical and semantical patterns and returning to a human-centered hypotheses refinement (Nelson, 2017; Reich et al., 2015). 3.8.3.3 Step 3: Pattern Confirmation The last step of the Phase III involves using computational methods to more reliably test the validity of the inductively identified patterns in the text (Nelson, 2017, p. 7). To put it another way, this will concern assessment of the detected and refined patterns through the prior steps by utilizing further computational and statistical techniques. At this stage, the semantic coherence and exclusivity for high likelihood models; LOESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) line of the topic proportions on a covariate; and topic correlations were tested for the model validity in a rigorous manner. Going through this Pattern Confirmation step, I was able to uncover the most salient patterns within and across the four NFB mailing lists over the past eleven years. 3.8.4 Phase V: Results Evaluation and Interpretation This last phase of the KDT model plays a conclusive role in integrating all prior analytical points into the study results through the researchers humanistic interpretation (U. M. Fayyad et al., 1996; Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995). All of the computational results have been repeatedly double-checked with my own interpretive reflexivity as one of the lifelong blind individuals pursuing STEM disciplines. Furthermore, I utilized the qualitative sources collected from the in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight blind members of the target NFB listservs (see Chapter 3.7.2) as an interpretive lens at a community level to triangulate the data-driven results. For the analysis of the qualitative interview data, I took fieldnotes and used my self-reflexivity as an autoethnographic tool (Ellis et al., 2011) to iteratively cross-check meaning of each interview response until I reached data saturation (Griffin &amp; Bengry-Howell, 2007). 3.9 Chapter Summary This chapter covered detailed methodological facets of conducting this research. The nature of a large-scale archived data introduced a new methodological challenge in conventional ethnography that used to adapting some limited boundary of data. Computational ethnography is well-suited emerging mixed methods with its scalable benefit to meet any size of data. On top of the computational participant-observation on the National Federation of the Blind STEM-oriented mailing archives (N = 24858), this research attempts to triangulate the data-driven research findings by mixing my unique positionality as a blind person along with the semi-structured interviews with eight informants of the target community. In terms of the data analysis, the five-phase Knowledge Discovery in Textual Databases (KDT) model (Feldman &amp; Dagan, 1995) have been implemented as a guiding framework, combined with the three-step Computational Grounded Theory (Nelson, 2017). Data management and analysis have been performed using statistical computing language R [Version 4.1.0; R Core Team (2019)] environment and required packages. All coding process employed for this research is provided as supplemental material (Appendix E; Appendix G) subscribing to the recent trend of reproducible research to demystify computer-assisted text analysis and enhance the study reliability. In the next chapter, I will report study findings corresponding to each of the research question. References Abramson, C. M., &amp; Dohan, D. (2015).

Besides directly STEM-related disciplines, I also included the Artists-Making-Art listserv for this study because of the following two reasons: (1) As the listservs name implies, I was expecting some content-creating (i.e., making) discussions out of this archive, which could provide potential resources on design thinking cultures of blind people that is highly interrelated to the majority of STEM subjects. (2) As the arts is one of the visual-demanding subject, I wanted to explore how blind people had accessed this area with what kind of non-visual sociotechnical solutions, which can permit some interesting food for thought on STEM challenges of blind learners.

As detailed in the previous Chapter, this computational ethnography takes convergent mixed methods design (Creswell, 2015) across quantitative and qualitative research. Firstly, a set of data-driven results from computational linguistics will be addressed corresponding to each of the quantitative research questions. Secondly, findings derived from in-depth semi-structured interviews will be shared to respond to two of the qualitative research questions. Finally, I will integrate these two strands to complement each other for a deeper understanding of the hybrid mixed-methods research question. However, a more extensive response to the primary research question will be covered in the next chapter. 4.2 Results from the Computational Participant-Observation In this section, I will report all the data analysis results addressing Chapter 1.4.1. For the sake of clarity, each of the data analysis results will be listed under their corresponding research questions. 4.2.1 Descriptive Questions 4.2.1.1 Quan RQ1.1: What are the frequency and variation patterns of collective knowledge participations of members in the target mailing listservs between January 2009 and December 2019? This question is concerned with the general trends on the four target listservs. As I transformed semi-structured mailing text into one-message-per-row structured tidy data-frame (Chapter 3.8.2), I was able to analyze overall trends of the target communities that I would have otherwise not been able to do with unstructured text in reproducible and efficient ways (Appendix I). Table 4.1 shows some descriptive information on the four NFB mailing lists. The following include descriptions of what each column indicates. Analysis period: calculated based on the timestamp of the first and the last message instances within each listserv. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was used to normalize different timezones of message senders. Total active participants: the total number of individuals involved within each listserv calculated by counting each unique email address of message senders. Total msg instances: the total number of messages sent in the listservs, comprising Number of msg to undefined references (messages replying to undefined message_ID within the given archive) and Number of identifiable msg (messages replying to another identifiable message). To get more accurate results, I removed Number of msg to undefined references from the calculations for the outcomes below. Number of thread: the total number of the messages having more than one conversation participants. Number of single msg: the total number of the messages having only one conversation participant. Number of collaborative msg: is the sum of Number of referenced initial msg (the total number of the identifiable original messages referenced by other replies) and Number of replying msg (the number of the replying messages referencing the initial messages). Total topics: the total number of the unique topics derrived from identifiable unique message_ID within each listserv, which can be broken down into Total replied topics and Total unreplied topics. Unreplied rate: the ratio of the total number of unreplied original messages to the total number of all the original messages across replied and unreplied ones.2 Replied rate: the inverse index to Unreplied rate (\\(1 - \\text{Unreplied Rate}\\)). Discussion start msg ratio to a total collaborative msg: the ratio of Number of referenced initial msg to Number of collaborative msg.

For example, the analysis of total msg instances (Figure 4.1) revealed that cs had the most participation (13,199 messages), followed by math (9,177), science (2,099), and arts (382). This rank pattern was found in other analyses such as period and number of collaborative msg. However, total active participants showed that math had more active members (684) than cs (538), and also higher replied rate (0.5913) than cs (0.5162). Although science listserv had more active members (287) than arts (44), it recorded much lower replied rate (0.2567) than arts (0.4641). In terms of discussion start ratio, the arts had the highest rate (0.3111) and the math showed the lowest (0.1796). This suggests members in math list were more likely to reply to other members messages than they initiated new messages while members in the arts more tended to start new messages. Table 4.2 briefly illustrates these patterns by the order of higher rank per category. Table 4.2: Pattern summary of the target listservs sorted by the top rank for each category. period active_participant total_instances collaborative_msg replied_rate discussion_start_ratio cs math cs cs math arts math cs math math cs science science science science science arts cs arts arts arts arts science math Figure 4.1: Bar chart showing the number of messages by the NFB listservs between 2009 and 2019. Accessible audio-chart can be found here. On the other hand, I counted total number of messages sent by each listserv member and compared the dispersion patterns across different listservs using a box plot. Figure 4.2 shows that all the mailing lists had narrow box areas between the first and third quartiles while having long upper whiskers between the third quartiles and maximum values, suggesting highly positive skewness. This implies that all the listservs, regardless of their absolute number of message instances exchanged, were led by few active members. This characteristic was found the most pronounced in the cs list given that it had the largest number of outliers. Figure 4.2: Box plot showing number of messages sent by each member, grouped by list. Accessible audio-chart can be found here. Finally, time series analysis indicated that the period between 2011 and 2014 was the most participated years across listservs (Figure 4.3) while the rate was relatively decreasing towards the end. Figure 4.3: Line chart showing Total n by year, grouped by list. Accessible audio-chart can be found here. 4.2.1.2 Quan RQ1.2: What are the top-10 most participated topics among members found in the target online listservs? Table 4.3 is the result of the analysis on the top-10 most participated topics found within each listserv. For this analysis, I used subject variable and counted its unique factor levels (i.e., subject lines) to identify what subjects were discussed the most among list members (Appendix I).

To answer this question, I used term frequencyinverse document frequency (tf-idf), which is a weighting term statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a corpus (Sammut &amp; Webb, 2010). Theorem 4.1 concisely explains this concept. Theorem 4.1 (tf-idf theorem.) \\[{\\text{IDF} = \\log{\\frac{{\\text{N}}}{{\\text{DF}}}}}\\] \\[{\\text{TF-IDF} = TF{\\times}\\log\\frac{{\\text{N}}}{{\\text{DF}}}}\\] The tf-idf value is useful in the sense that it can isolate a documents most important words from the kinds of words that tend to be highly frequent across a set of documents in that language (Sammut &amp; Webb, 2010; Silge &amp; Robinson, 2017). Figure 4.4 and Table H.1 illustrate what kinds of words appeared to be salient within each listserv based on the top-10 tf-idf values. Figure 4.4: The top-10 most salient words in each of the four NFB mailing lists. The tf-idf results indicated what keywords were the most important concepts within each mailing list. In the arts list, tangible materials (e.g., pottery, fiber, kiln) seemed to be subject to active discussion. The word craftyfrugalmom was emergent because it was the online site where one of the list members whose nickname was crafty frugal mom sold her handmade products, such as tissue covers. Another active member in the arts list had advertised his music production on the Sound Cloud under the artist name blindworrell. Given the small number of membership, the arts corpus was highly affected by few members, resulting in their messages as representative words. In contrast, the other three mailing lists having relatively larger memberships yielded some reliable results. The cs had operating system keywords (Linux; Microsoft) as well as their keyboard accessibility. Programming languages, such as Java and Cobol, were actively discussed with command line options and an open-source screen reader NVDA. For the math list, many technical terms emerged, such as LaTeX, MathML, MathPlayer because these were the assistive technologies that blind people used when accessing digital Math content in an accessible way. In other words, the members of the math listserv were actively discussing how to utilize such assistive technologies for their math classes, and these were the topics for which people were asking help the most. Finally, the science listserv revealed some intresting keywords, such as eyesonsuccess, episode, and podcast. This is because the eyes on success podcast (http://eyesonsuccess.net/) hosted and produced by Peter Torpey and Nancy Goodman Torpey played a central role in the science mailing list corpus. The Torpeys both have PhDs in Physics and retired from Xerox Corporation after over 25 years in corporate research. Nancy is sighted and Pete is blind, and the couple produces weekly online podcast episode that contains a wide range of content concerning science accessibility for the blind. Their podcast (EyesOnSuccess) continuously delivered and advocated for science topics for blind individuals to connect with each other. 4.2.2 Semantic Network Questions Although the tf-idf analysis provided few important terms in the mailing lists, it did not offer relational information between the words. To investigate semantic network patterns of the target listservs, I conducted the following three network analyses on the corpus. (1) Co-occurrence network analysis; (2) Correlation analysis; and (3) bigram network analysis. The co-occurrence network analysis, as the collective interconnection of terms, was made based on paired presence of the words within the email corpus. It was calculated by how frequent two words appeared together within a document (Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016). The correlation network analysis was computed by \\(\\phi\\) coefficient, introduced by Karl Pearson (Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016). While the co-occurrence analysis was only focused on the paired presence and their frequencies, the correlation analysis was useful in that it revealed statistically significant interrelation between words. The bigram network analysis was employed to discover more contextual nuance, which the other networks could have had missed, as the nodes relations indicated sequential patterns between words (Silge &amp; Robinson, 2016). I analyzed what kinds of word sequences were highly populated within each listserv using bigram (a pair of sequential two words). Across all the three different networks, I used R package tidygraphs default centrality (Barrat et al., 2004), and added community structure that minimized the expected description length of a random walker trajectory (Rosvall et al., 2009; Rosvall &amp; Bergstrom, 2007). The following include the three network analysis results per listserv. 4.2.2.1 Quan RQ2.1: What are the most common co-occurring words in each mailing list? Figure 4.5 depicts the co-occurrence network analysis result across all the four mailing lists. The corresponding table is also provided as an accessible format (Table H.2).

Figure 4.17: Bigram network graph with the top-20 pairs for arts listserv. 4.2.3 Data Clustering Questions 4.2.3.1 Quan RQ3.1: What are estimated latent topics across all of the four target mailing lists calculated by Structural Topic Models? (simply stated, What kinds of conversations are provoked across all of the four NFB mailing lists?) While semantic network provides general ideas, topic modeling offers more nuenced themes. To estimate latent topics, I trained multiple Structural Topic Models (M. E. Roberts et al., 2013) with different number of topics (K = 20 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 100) based on the content variable that included message body text. The optimal number of topics (K) was chosen based on two strategies: (1) the diagnostic analysis on held-out likelihood and residuals (Figure 4.18), and (2) relationship analysis between semantic coherence and exclusivity (Figure 4.19). Figure 4.18: Model diagnostics by number of topics. The held-out likelihood is highest between 20 and 50, and the residuals are lowest around 40. Figure 4.19: Comparing exclusivity and semantic coherence. Models with fewer topics have higher semantic coherence than more topics, but lower exclusivity. Drawing upon these holistic diagnostics, I determined 40 as the optimal number of topics for the given corpus and extracted the topic prevalence in the corpus (Table 4.12). In the Table, \\(\\theta\\) matrix indicates the probabilities that each document is generated from each topic; each topic is a mixture of probabilistically contributing words. Table 4.12: Document-Topic prevalence in the corpus with the top 6 words that contribute to each topic. topic theta term Topic 26 0.0580 key, control, enter, press, type, button Topic 27 0.0439 jaws, screen, reader, read, software, nvda Topic 32 0.0434 job, agree, company, world, accessibility, hard Topic 10 0.0430 question, experience, answer, understand, issue, specific Topic 9 0.0413 student, college, class, school, university, learn Topic 19 0.0413 latex, document, format, convert, file, pdf Topic 8 0.0390 accessible, accessibility, web, site, link, free Topic 18 0.0369 microsoft, fix, issue, update, happen, office Topic 21 0.0361 program, code, language, write, java, learn Topic 36 0.0326 drive, laptop, machine, usb, pc, system Topic 12 0.0326 hear, send, hope, call, post, day Topic 20 0.0320 linux, run, install, system, machine, server Topic 6 0.0317 file, download, copy, save, xp, message Topic 4 0.0316 engineer, student, meet, research, stem, national Topic 17 0.0304 braille, book, print, display, code, text Topic 34 0.0293 symbol, write, line, table, dot, formula Topic 28 0.0287 easy, reason, remember, sort, wrong, correct Topic 39 0.0284 device, app, display, iphone, phone, buy Topic 38 0.0266 graph, calculator, teacher, sight, understand, concept Topic 37 0.0257 graphic, image, tactile, diagram, embosser, produce Topic 2 0.0231 test, stuff, start, break, suppose, week Topic 11 0.0229 product, company, feature, freedom, software, scientific Topic 25 0.0203 net, audio, host, note, success, eyesonsuccess Topic 31 0.0195 public, organization, national, agency, contact, job Topic 15 0.0185 phone, service, twitter, technology, fax, facebook Topic 23 0.0177 mathplayer, mathml, mathtype, equation, en, support Topic 33 0.0175 support, process, standard, add, exist, involve Topic 5 0.0171 aph, draw, paper, tactile, board, model Topic 16 0.0170 excel, datum, software, command, statistic, spss Topic 29 0.0160 love, life, story, idea, artist, time Topic 22 0.0138 field, benefit, career, skill, time, favor Topic 40 0.0132 time, idea, solution, sound, mind, share Topic 1 0.0127 article, news, visit, excellent, book, publication Topic 24 0.0120 svg, file, program, tutorial, draw, java Topic 7 0.0119 error, receive, intend, information, immediately, attachment Topic 14 0.0117 pay, address, talk, complaint, personal, doubt Topic 13 0.0104 library, opinion, engineer, national, nls, physically Topic 30 0.0052 id, aim, radio, spanish, zone, english Topic 3 0.0045 register, missouri, registration, wednesday, convention, contest Topic 35 0.0022 coin, child, literacy, percent, independence, vehicle I found that most of the topics were focused on questions and answers about how to use Windows (topics 26; 6) and Microsoft Office suite (topic 18) with screen-reading software (topic 27). Topic 26, in particular, showed that blind people rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts when using computers. This is because mouse control is challenging for blind people to interact with GUI interfaces. While general computer usage on the Windows operating system seemed to be the most active listserv topics, there were other topics concerning STEM accessibility. For example, topic 9 illustrated active discussions on disability services and accommodations at universities. Topics 19 and 23, on the other hand, were very specific to discussions on math accessibility while topic 4 was about the general information on STEM accessibility meeting at the NFB community. More advanced listserv discussions were also found. Java programming (topic 21) and Linux system engineering (topic 20) and computer device management (topic 36) revealed that blind people can achieve high-level computational work as long as the related environments are configured to their assistive technologies (e.g., refreshable Braille display = Topic 17; screen readers = Topic = 27). There were some topics very specific to tactile alternatives. Topics 5, 36, and 38 were concerned about how to use tactile products, such as braille embossers and tactile drawing kits, to alternate visual outcomes which is a critical modality in learning STEM subjects. However, there were few topics that needed to be filtered out. Topic 7 and 14 were a set of texts for either the listserv email header or email footer. This suggests that unsupervised topic modeling is also useful to identify such trivial patterns that predefined regular expressions could have missed. 4.2.3.2 Quan RQ3.2: In what ways are the estimated structural topics correlated with each other? To calculate sophisticated correlation matrix, I used the semiparametric procedure in the R package huge (Zhao et al., 2012) and Meinshausen et al. (2006) graph estimation. Such estimated topic correlations were visualized using the igraph (Csardi et al., 2006) package to plot a network where nodes are topics and edges indicate a positive correlation (Figure 4.20). Figure 4.20: Topic correlation plot. I also created hierarchical correlation clustering plot using Data-Driven Documents (\\(D^3\\), Bostock et al., 2011) which is accessible as an online resource. 4.2.3.3 Quan RQ3.3: How does the rate of topics (i.e., topical prevalence) change over time? To answer this question, I fitted a regression model using stm package (M. Roberts et al., 2019) with year being a single covariate after a base spline transformation (see Table H.15 for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-year prevalence (\\(\\theta\\)) patterns using a heatmap (Figure 4.21). Figure 4.21: Heatmap showing topic prevalence by year. 4.2.3.4 Quan RQ3.4: How do these topical distributions (detected from RQ3.1) vary by the four types of the NFB mailing lists? This time, I fitted a regression model using stm package (M. Roberts et al., 2019) with list being a single factor covariate (see Table H.16 for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-list prevalence (\\(\\theta\\)) patterns using a heatmap (Figure 4.22). Figure 4.22: Heatmap showing topic prevalence by list. 4.2.3.5 Quan RQ3.5: How do the detected topical distributions vary by the type of mailing lists over time? I fitted multi-regression models using stm package (M. Roberts et al., 2019) with two covariates (i.e., list factor and spline-transformed year predictor). No interaction effect between the two covariates was considered for this analysis (see Table H.18 for the complete regression result). I then visualized the topic-by-year prevalence (\\(\\theta\\)) patterns for each of the four listservs using a heatmap (Figure 4.23). Figure 4.23: Heatmap showing topic prevalence by year for each of the four listservs. 4.3 Findings from Semi-Structured Interviews In parallel with the computational results above, I also conducted semi-structured interviews with eight individuals recruited from the NFB mailing lists to better understand meaning of the discovered knowledge patterns (see Chapter 3.7.2). The interview took place between February 2020 and December 2020, and each of the eight interviews was carried out on Zoom Conference platform due to its great accessibility features for screen readers. Each session lasted approximately an hour following carefully prepared semi-structured interview protocol, which included few questions about their visual impairments, learning experiences in STEM subjects, experience with the NFB mailing lists, and demographic information (see Appendix C.3). With the participants consent, all the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for further analysis (Appendix D includes interview transcripts). Throughout the interview process, I was attempting to find answers to the following two research questions. (1) Qual RQ1: What are the common STEM-related issues of blind learners? (2) Qual RQ2: What strategies are utilized by blind individuals to pursue STEM disciplines? Below are the three saturated thematic results cutting across the two research questions. 4.3.1 Self-Directed Learning Over Lectures The first thematic result found from the interview is that blind people tend to rely on self-directed learning strategies over classroom lectures due to inaccessible classroom environments. This means blind people often fall behind in classrooms where instructors use a visual channel as a primary communication. Because of the lack of verbally understandable content, blind learners choose to catch up with the classroom content later on following their pace and alternative learning strategies. To highlight this point, Id like to share an example of my participants experiences. Participant 1 (P1) was a 32-year-old Caucasian man in San Francisco who was pursuing his Bachelor degree in Physics. He identified his visual impairment level as Severe vision impairment. He had been a member of two NFB STEM listservs (i.e., Science and engineering; BlindMath) for four months as of the interview. R: Okay, so what are the most challenging issues for you to learn stem related content as being blind. P1: So, right now, whats really difficult is Math and diagrams. Getting math and any sort of diagram or model in an accessible format. And thats been kind of the biggest hurdle in the classroom so far. In physics, there are a lot of a lot of things are taught using visual aids diagrams and models and stuff so I dont have access to that. R: So thats been probably the biggest issue. P1: Yeah, as well as getting math equations that are accessible. Ton of equations. I still dont want to have to memorize them so nice to have a formula sheet. R: I see, then, how have you addressed those problems and what strategies have you utilized? P1: So for the formulas I my professor hands out a formula at the beginning of the term. So Ive made my own accessible version of  R: Oh, how do you do that? P1: I just typed it up in word, its not very fancy or anything. Its basically if anyone else were to read it in. Yeah, be confusing, but it works for me. So I just need a generally I have the formulas mostly memorize. Anyways, after hearing all so its its really just jogged my memory. Basically, when I can. So I am I am starting to learn latex just swing and actually do real good looking math formulas, but just for now I just read stuff in Word documents, thats R: WOW Incredible! P1: Me. Yeah. So my own kind of like personal notes. P1 developed his own strategies to organize math formulas against visual and inaccessible classroom learning. In terms of how much information a blind person gets out of STEM lectures, participant 3 (P3) shared related experience during his interview. P3 is a 41-year-old post-doctoral researcher holding a Ph.D. degree in Particle Physics. P3 identified himself as a totally blind person with zero vision. He was originally from Pakistan, and moved to the United States when he was 23 for his second Bachelor in Physics. He had been a member of the NFB BlindMath listserv since 2001 (about 18-year subscription). P3: The classrooms were a little funky because when teachers started writing on the board, it becomes hard to follow. The university used to provide note takers. Some students would be hired to take notes and give them to me, but following the lecture itself was always. I didnt get too much out of the lectures. I didnt get that much out of lectures, that was always a problem. R: I understand. P3: Even in grad school at times I felt like it was a waste of time to even go to a lecture, so I would stay at home and read. But although I did attend lectures, but in hindsight. If I could do it again, Im not sure if I would attend the lectures as much or who knows maybe I would, but following lectures was difficult. Even now when Im attending seminars, people start writing on the board the equations, thats the part thats bad, thats difficult. I do my homework, the same kind of WinTriangle format. The similar struggles of blind learners in STEM classrooms could be found in the collected email corpus as a pronounced pattern. Figure 4.24 represents some of these voiced by the NFB listserv members. Figure 4.24: Email corpus representing blind students challenge in lectures. 4.3.2 Linear Verbal Learning The second thematic characteristic is concerned with in what ways blind STEM learners digest such highly vision-dominant information. In other words, I focused on what technologies and modalities blind individuals had been using for their STEM learning. According to my interviews with eight STEM learners with visual impairments, the most common issue with learning STEM content was math accessibility. Since Mathematics plays a critical role in STEM disciplines as a logical backend (Christenson, 2011), math accessibility was directly related to students success in STEM (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Thus, the following include some excerpts as to how blind learners approached math content. Participant 4 (P4) was a 22-year white female undergrad student pursuing Biochemistry in Delaware. She self-identified her level of visual impairment as Severe vision impairment. She had been subscribing to both Science and engineering and BlindMath listservs for two years. R: Do you tend to go to and ask disability office to provide you with some accessible materials? Or do you communicate directly with your professor first? P4: It depends on the material so if its something that has a lot of mathematical formula, Ive had some calculus professors who write all of their tests and things in LaTeX. So I knew how to read LaTeX and so they just gave me a digital copy of the test. But for other professors, for example for chemistry, where it is very image-based and does involve a lot of translation and transcription of something visual and something tactile. Thats definitely where Id involve, disability services because its not the professors area of expertise. R: Yeah. Okay. Let me ask this question, you mentioned youre using LaTeX. P4: Yes. R: What other technology do you use specifically for your math and science classes like MathML or other? P4: I do use MathML in a lot of cases, when I get textbooks, for example my physics textbook is in MathML. And so I use that in grids for the braille display so I can read equations for easily, its helpful to have the braille display as well as speech to make sure Im not missing anything. So Id say thats primarily what I do, I tend to avoid hard copy braille whenever I can. And lately as you know [crosstalk 00:14:22]. R: Because of the bulky volume. P4: Yeah. So bulky, yeah. R: LaTeX is really complex when it gets longer. P4: It is. Yes. R: So do you primarily use LaTeX for a writing purpose or reading purpose? P4: I would say primarily for reading purposes, I have a shorter hand notation that I use to work problems. But if the professor asks that to be translated into LaTeX I can. Typically what I will do is write, if the professor knows LaTeX, Ill write my final answer in LaTeX and if theyre curious about my work, they can go back and look at the shorthand notation that I typically just use Computer Braille when Im writing out because I realized Nemeth is great and everything; but it takes up a little bit more room than Computer Braille does. So Ive realized that because in Computer Braille you dont have to have the number symbol at the front, you dont have to have the equal sign takes up two cells instead of one. So that was just a decision I made based on efficiency. R: Awesome. Whats your special strategy for the back translation between Braille Nemeth Code and sided print. P4: So it depends, I would say since I do a lot of my stuff visually, it just depends on what the professor wants. Like I said, if the professor knows LaTeX then I just write out my answers in LaTeX and use MathType or some other add-on to convert that to a PDF and then either email it to a TA or whoevers grading it. Or for example, if Im taking a test in the disability office, theyll typically put the test on a flash drive, I will take the test and then theyll somehow either print it out; or get it to the professor that way or somehow find a way to get it to them digitally. And especially this semester, professors have been great about TAs or whoevers grading has been great about getting me things back in a digital format. So that I can actually see, Okay, heres what I wrote, potentially any comments or anything the professor made. So that Im not having to rely on sighted assistance to read me back my graded papers, which is nice. R: Cool. P4, did you go to special school for the blind? P4: I did not. I was mainstreamed my whole life. R: Then, how did you learn the math code and LaTeX and other blind skills for STEM. P4: So in early life, I had a teacher of the visually impaired so it was from, I would say early childhood all the way up until eighth grade. And then in high school, I was actually in a private high school so I did not have a teacher of the visually impaired. So a lot of the STEM related skills that I learned other than, I learned Nemeth in early elementary school and things like that. But I really did teach myself a lot, I taught myself LaTeX so it was very much My motivation was there and so I pretty much told myself, Okay, heres a solution to this problem, heres how to Because its hard for someone to teach you a programming language [crosstalk 00:17:49] you have to teach yourself. So thats how it ended up working out. As mentioned in the excerpt above, blind students rely heavily on LaTeX, a plaintext typeset system, when reading and writing Math content. This general tendency can be found in the Math list corpus as reported in Figure 4.11. According to Seo &amp; McCurry (2019), LaTeX has been widely used and recommended among blind people in STEM disciplines; however, it requires a steep learning curve. For example, the Theorem 4.2 illustrates what LaTeX markup looks like. Theorem 4.2 (LaTeX example theorem.) \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4} \\] is the result of the following LaTeX code: \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4} Since LaTeX markup is presented in a linear fashion, it demands a heavier cognitive cost than image display in human short-term memory (Clark &amp; Paivio, 1991). As P4 mentioned, on the other hand, blind students often utilize refreshable braille display, the hardware device for presenting literary braille chords in a tactile form (Figure 4.25). Figure 4.25: Refreshable braille display.. Although such assistive technology can reduce some short-term memory cost, the linear nature of braille system makes it hard for blind people to get a high level picture of complex equations which would typically be represented in a two-dimensional visual form for sighted people (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008; Seo &amp; McCurry, 2019). 4.3.3 Positive Attitudes The third thematic finding suggests that the interviewees did not consider their visual impairments as a stumbling block for learning STEM content; rather, they leveraged the visual challenges as a source of problem-solving efforts. The following interview excerpt of the participant 4 (P4) clearly illustrates this point. P4: And then in college I actually started out at a small liberal arts school in Virginia and then I realized as I got more involved with my degree, I was originally a pre-med student. And then I realized I enjoyed chemistry and that there wasnt a lot of computational chemistry opportunities. And a lot of people ask me, Did you go into computational chemistry because youre blind? Was it something you felt relegated to? And I felt like I love computer science and I love writing code and so I was excited because computational chemistry was my two loves all in one thing. [00:02:30 - 00:03:08] . . . . . . R: As far as I understand, the reason why you were seeking computational chemistry specifically is because of your blindness? P4: Actually not necessarily, I just personally really enjoy computational chemistry and Ive always really liked the theory behind chemistry more than Ive liked being in the lab. So I wouldnt say that its because of my blindness, Id just say more of thats what I enjoy most about chemistry. [00:09:49 - 00:10:21] Likewise, most of the interviewees had positive attitudes towards STEM disciplines regardless of their visual impairments. To highlight this point, I am sharing the three questions about their perception on STEM that I asked to each of the eight participants. The participants major and demographic information can be found in Table 3.3. Q1. I feel learning STEM subjects is ___. P1: Fascinating rewarding but very difficult. P2: [inaudible] P3: Interesting and exciting. P4: Challenging and rewarding. P5: Challenging, but ultimately rewarding. P6: Empowering. P7: A wise career path for blind students. P8: Hard. Q2. I think pursuing STEM disciplines as being blind is ___. P1: Its great. I wish more people did it. P2: Its challenging, and its very hard work and a deep attention to pursue STEM filling in. P3: Possible, but requires determination. P4: Theres so much I want to say. Im trying to Okay, lets see. I would say an adventure. P5: A viable goal. P6: Powerful. P7: Challenging but not impossible. P8: Worth it. Q3. To succeed in STEM fields, a blind person needs ___. P1: Support and opportunities from friends, family and basically faculty. P2: HTML. He has to. He has to put an extra effort. P3: Hard work and determination and somewhat more than your other sighted peers. P4: To be a strong advocate and to be a problem solver. P5: Im not sure of how to keep it to one sentence, but I think that the biggest thing is that they need to not have a fear of failure. What worked for one person might not work for them, you might need to try five different sources of information until you finally find one that clicks or maybe you need to try something multiple times before you find the way. Theres almost always a way as long as you can keep whatever drives you internally to continue moving forward, as long as you can keep that, then you can find a way. P6: Persevere. P7: Motivation and perseverance. P8: Tenacity. As stated in each of the participants excerpts, STEM is perceived as an area of possible adventure. The general trend of blind peoples positive attitude for STEM fields can be found in the sentimental analysis of the NFB mailing corpus (Figure 4.26). In sum, despite various challenges, blind people pursuing STEM disciplines tended to focus on their capabilities rather than difficiencies. Figure 4.26: Sentiment analysis on the four NFB STEM mailing listservs. 4.4 Comprehensive Results Although each separate strand of the computational and qualitative data analyses offers their own investigative values, it is not quite clear for audience to get a sense of the analytical points in a concise manner. For example, interpretation of the results from the computational linguistics may be challenging for those not having any prior contextual information or knowledge on the target community. The structural topic modeling results, in particular, do not make sense without an extensive further exploration and/or interactions with the original document sources. Furthermore, the patterns that emerged out of the structural topic models make it difficult to understand due to its massive information (K = 40). The qualitative data, on the other hand, offers a deeper interpretative ground for audience. Still, it may miss general patterns as it tends to highlight some detailed phenomena out of discourse text. One of the effective ways to address these issues is mixing the strong points of the two strands. That is, integrating the computational patterns into the qualitative interpretations. From the unsupervised machine learning offered by abductive structural topic models (Chapter 4.2.3), I obtained various patterns of the 40 topics. From the semi-structured interviews with eight individuals with visual impairments in STEM fields (Chapter 4.3), I developed how to interpret these patterns. What I am trying to do in the next section is to deductively refine the computationally captured patterns through an interpretative lense developed by the iterative communication with my eight blind informants. 4.4.1 Mixed RQ: What results emerge from comparing the qualitative interviews about the STEM-learning experiences of blind individuals with the computational outcomes derived from the STEM-oriented listservs? To respond to this hybrid mixed-method research question, I reduced the 40 topics of the structural topic models into 9 interpretative codes. For this pattern refinement process, I rested upon the Ecological Model of STEM Education (Basham et al., 2010) as primary categories (see Chapter 2.4.1). Although Basham et al. (2010) originally suggested four nested systems for inclusive STEM education (i.e., macro-; exo-; meso-; and microsystem), the macrosystemthe foremost worldwide level including social and political impact on global STEM education systemwas excluded for this coding process as the scope went beyond the current target corpus data. Table 4.13 shows how I refined the coding schemes.

Unix system engineering is also included. 20, 21 micro mobile_apps iOS, Android, Blackberry, 11, 39 Based on the coding scheme, I deductively and interpretively assigned binary code (1 or 0) to each of the mailing list documents. More specifically, I used nested \\(\\theta\\) mean threshold (grouped by list, year, and topic) to determine the code assignment. I gave TRUE (i.e., 1) value to topics higher than the mean threshold, otherwise FALSE (i.e., 0) value (see Appendix I). Figure 4.27 is the visualized result of code-by-year patterns that I obtained by counting the number of TRUE binary code by year across all the four NFB STEM mailing lists. Discussions on screen-reader use emerged as the most significant pattern over time, followed by math-related technologies (e.g., LaTeX; MathML), which belong to microsystem of the ecological STEM education. That is, blind people were active in discussing how to utilize assistive technologies that could play a critical role in their STEM learning contexts. There were few relatively weaker, yet stable, patterns within macrosystem, such as discussions on tactile graphs, programming, and mobile_apps. I assume that these were special topics discussed among some groups of members over time. The text-to-tactile system for blind people, Braille and its related technologies, was the least emerging code within the microsystem category, which may be related to braille literacy crisis that less than 10 percent school-age children in the United States can read and write braille (Jernigan Institute, 2009; National Braille Press, n.d.). Interestingly, community support, such as the NFB Annual Convension, STEM extension workshop tailored for blind students, and online broadcast programs (e.g., EyesOnSuccess Podcast) showed a consistently strong trend over. This indicates exosystem, which speaks to how well state and regional community supports STEM education (Basham et al., 2010). On the other hand, codes representing mesosystem, such as job and classroom accessibility revealed fewer frequencies, which could be interpreted in either way: (1) Blind people were more intersted in technical topics on how to use a set of assistive technologies for learning STEM content at their individual level rather than discussing the STEM accessibility at a mesosystem level; or (2) This pattern may reveal the lack of mesosystem accessibility consideration in STEM classrooms and workplaces. I will revisit this point in the next chapter for further discussions. These all the patterns had on-and-off trends, and the frequencies in 2010, 2015, and 2019 years were found to be the lowest. Figure 4.27: Heatmap showing code count by year. To take a closer look at these captured patterns, I also visualized code-by-year nested by each of the four NFB STEM mailing lists. Figure 4.28 illustrates the results. While the overall patterns discovered in Figure 4.27 can also be found this time, there are few notable interesting points. First, the cs and math lists seemed active over time whereas the arts and science were less participated. This aligns with the first result conducted in Chapter 4.2.1. Second, while the cs had stable patterns until 2019, the math, which had stronger participation than the cs in 2011, became somewhat decreasing in recent years. Finally, despite the importance of braille literacy in the math, the discourse concerning braille was not found to be significant among the members of the listserv compared to other codes. Figure 4.28: Heatmap showing code count by year for each of the four listservs. 4.5 Chapter Summary This chapter reported computational and qualitative results separately and combine the two strands at the end. The computational analyses revealed that computer science (CS) was the most active and the Arts was the least participated listserv. Although science listserv had more active members (287) than arts (44), it recorded much lower replied rate (0.2567) than arts (0.4641). The dispersion patterns of the total number of messages sent by each listserv member showed that all the listservs, regardless of their absolute number of message instances exchanged, were led by few active members. This characteristic was found the most pronounced in the cs list given that it had the largest number of outliers (Figure 4.2). Semantic analyses including co-occurrence, correlation, and bigram networks, revealed that unique linguistic and knowledge-sharing patterns on each of the mailing lists, and these were confirmed with more advanced structural topic models (STM) fitted with 40 topics. The semi-structured interview findings with eight individuals who are blind or visually impaired yielded three themes: (1) Self-directed learning over lectures; (2) Linear verbal learning; and (3) Positive attitudes. These were repeatedly confirmed with both computational results as well as cross-interview checking. The hybrid mixed-method result that combined both computational and interpretative strands allowed me to deductively reduce the structural topic model patterns into 9 codes based on the nested systems introduced in Ecological Model of STEM Education (Basham et al., 2010). By analyzing both code-by-year and code-by-year-by-list patterns, it was found that microsystem-level technologies, such as screen readers and math-technologies accounted for most of the code patterns across all the corpus documents. In contrast, mesosystem-level conversations, such as support from and for schools and workplaces in STEM learning, was lacking. Furthermore, despite the importance of braille literacy in STEM education and its positive correlation with employment rate (National Braille Press, n.d.), knowledge-sharing patterns around braille was less pronounced compared to other microsystem technologies. This was congruent with current braille literacy crisis (Jernigan Institute, 2009). In the next chapter, I will conclude this study by circling back around to primary research question.

In the previous chapter, both computational results and qualitative findings were reported, and hybrid mixed-methods results were also suggested as a form of deductively and interpretatively refined code patterns. I will begin this chapter by highlighting some discussion points on how these findings can contribute to the primary research question of this study. Next, I will conclude this chapter by talking about suggestions for future research. 5.2 Discussions and Implications The purpose of this study was to discover collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines as captured through computer-mediated mailing listservs (Chapter 1.3). With this research goal, I proposed a set of research questions including computational and qualitative strands under the following primary research question: Primary RQ: What are the sociocultural characteristics of collective knowledge-sharing patterns produced by blind learners pursuing STEM disciplines? In the section below, I will circle back to this fundamental research question. To answer this question, I will frame my discussions within the Ecological Model of STEM Education (Basham et al., 2010) and will also take Alison Kafers political/relational model of disability, where disability is viewed as a product of social relations (Kafer, 2013). 5.2.1 Disconnected Mesosystem According to Ecological Model of STEM Education (Basham et al., 2010), inclusive and accessible STEM education takes place when the following four systems are ecologically connected. (1) Macrosystem which refers to social and political values in STEM; (2) Exosystem concerned with regional and state impact on and community-level support for STEM; (3) Mesosystem covering school and workplace environments for STEM support; and Microsystem representing any individual-level communication and technical support for STEM education. These are not exclusive; rather, they contribute to each other towards a more inclusive STEM ecosystem (Basham et al., 2010). As stated in Chapter 4.4.1, the macrosystem went beyond the scope of this study so I attempted to capture the rest three dimensions out of the NFB STEM-oriented email corpus (see the coding scheme Table 4.13). One of the notable patterns found out of coding results is that there were considerably fewer mesosystem-level discussions (e.g., classroom and workplace accessibility issues) than either microsystem-level technologies (e.g., screen readers; accessible math technologies) or exosystem, such as community support (Figure 4.27 and Figure 4.28). This implies that blind STEM learners were likely to address their STEM accessibility within their microsystem level, such as training themselves assistive technologies, or within exosystem by developing community-level support (e.g., the NFB Annual Convension; the NFB STEM mentoring workshop; EyesOnSuccess Podcast). To put it another way, how blind STEM learners dealt with mesosystem-level support, such as schools, classrooms, workplaces and their environments was not as pronounced as its importance and necessisity. This trend was also confirmed with the semi-structured interviews with blind STEM learners, resulting in the second qualitative theme, Self-Directed Learning Over Lectures (Chapter 4.3.1). As shared in participant 3s (P3) excerpt, he explicitly stated that he did not get much out of lectures; instead, he went back home and had to do his own catch-up studies. The disconnected mesosystem (e.g., inaccessible classroom settings) may force blind STEM learners to be left with all the responsibilities for their own STEM frustration (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013; Samsonov et al., 2006; Thurston et al., 2017). From a viewpoint inspired by political/relational model of disability (Kafer, 2013), this current trend may also be understood as a form of perpetuating social exclusion against disability. 5.2.2 Limited Modality of Current Assistive Technologies Another implication we can take out of this study is concerned with limitations of current assistive technologies. The most salient patterns discovered across all the mailing lists corpus revealed that blind people had relied heavily on text-to-speech screen readers for their STEM content access, which utilizes humans verbal channel. According to dual coding theory (Clark &amp; Paivio, 1991), humans learn better when information is double-encoded through both verbal (e.g., text) and non-verbal (e.g., images) because it helps reduce heavy cognitive load in our short-term memory. Although people with visual impairments or blindness have some difficulties accessing non-verbal images in a direct way, it does not mean that there is no way for them to digest such visual information. For example, images can be expressed in tangible and tactile forms or in non-speech 3-dimensional auditory forms (i.e., sonification). Despite some alternative non-verbal modalities, however, current assistive technologies used among blind STEM learners seemed to remain in verbal channel exclusively. For instance, accessible math technologies (e.g., LaTeX; MathML; MathType) are all the math-to-text assistive technologies relying on verbal channel as does screen readers use text-to-speech verbal channel. Likewise, refreshable braille display also rests upon text-to-tactile linear verbal channel (Figure 4.25). These technologies, while largely contributing to information access in general for blind people, demand cognitvely extensive load in their working memory. This implies that such limited modality of current assistive technologies may cause another layer of barrier against blind STEM learners. Consequently, much more research on assistive technologies reducing heavy cognitive load through the use of non-verbal channel is required. If active research and development can lead to some practical success (e.g., image-to-sound (sonification) and image-to-tactile haptics), we will witness that more blind learners engage into STEM subjects. 5.2.3 Lacking Central Resources Finally, the knowledge-sharing patterns discovered within the NFB listservs highlighted the lack of central resources supporting blind STEM learners socio-technical needs. For the social aspect, most of the email conversations were produced and contributed by few groups of members as analyzed in the positively skewed disperssion patterns (Figure 4.2). Semi-structured interviews with eight informants confirmed such characteristicsix out of the eight informants stated that they defined their role in the listservs as a peripheral observer who does not actively participate in the conversation, although tracks down what people talk about in the list (Table 3.3). From a technical viewpoint, this highly skewed participation indicates that blind STEM learners know-hows (i.e., collective knowledge) had been shaped by few members, leaving other remaining knowledge of the peripheral observers, whose know-hows could have been instrumental to other members, undiscoverable. Again, the lack of central socio-technical resources may perpetuate the situation in which each individual has to figure out how to tackle STEM accessibility issue within a microsystem domain. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to how we can systematically build community-level knowledge archives using both large-scale corpus produced by the NFB listserv members as well as collecting hands-on experience and knowledge from blind STEM professionals. 5.3 Conclusions 5.3.1 Summary and Contribution Thus far, this dissertation study has attempted to respond to the paucity of scholarly and practical attention to how blind individuals learn STEM subjects. The study aim was to discover collective knowledge sharing patterns and informal learning cultures of blind individuals pursuing STEM disciplines as captured through computer-mediated mailing listservs. Using the National Federation of the Blind Mailing List, which is one of the worlds largest online mailing communities for the blind, this research conducted longitudinal computational ethnography for the four STEM-oriented listserv archives in the public domain (i.e., NFB-Science and Engineering; Computer Science; Artists-Making-Art; BlindMath) between January 2009 and December 2019 to develop a comprehensive understanding of learning experiences voiced by blind individuals. A total of 24858 messages was computationally analyzed and approximately 15-hour interviews with eight blind STEM learners were qualitatively analyzed. The dispersion patterns of the total number of messages sent by each listserv member showed that all the listservs, regardless of their absolute number of message instances exchanged, were led by few active members. This characteristic was found the most pronounced in the cs list given that it had the largest number of outliers (Figure 4.2). Semantic analyses including co-occurrence, correlation, and bigram networks, revealed that unique linguistic and knowledge-sharing patterns on each of the mailing lists, and these were confirmed with more advanced structural topic models (STM) fitted with 40 topics. The semi-structured interview findings with eight individuals who are blind or visually impaired yielded three themes: (1) Self-directed learning over lectures; (2) Linear verbal learning; and (3) Positive attitudes. These were repeatedly confirmed with both computational results as well as cross-interview checking. The hybrid mixed-method result that combined both computational and interpretative strands allowed me to deductively reduce the structural topic model patterns into 9 codes based on the nested systems introduced in Ecological Model of STEM Education (Basham et al., 2010). By analyzing both code-by-year and code-by-year-by-list patterns, it was found that microsystem-level technologies, such as screen readers and math-technologies accounted for most of the code patterns across all the corpus documents. In contrast, mesosystem-level conversations, such as support from and for schools and workplaces in STEM learning, was lacking. Furthermore, despite the importance of braille literacy in STEM education and its positive correlation with employment rate (National Braille Press, n.d.), knowledge-sharing patterns around braille was less pronounced compared to other microsystem technologies. This was congruent with current braille literacy crisis (Jernigan Institute, 2009). Building upon these results and findings, I discussed the implications of this study by highlighting the three aspects: (1) Disconnected mesosystem; (2) Limited modality of current assistive technologies; and (3) Lacking central resources. The findings of this dissertation study should make an important contribution to the field of the Learning Sciences in the following ways. Firstly, this scientific investigation of How blind people learn STEM can bring meaningful discussion points to the field. Although How People \\[emphasis added\\] Learn should be applied to any inquiries of the Learning Sciences, current scholarly efforts in the field have been largely devoted to learning improvements from and for so-called able-bodied viewpoints. In other words, the field has yet neglected to extend the scope of learners across dis/abilities while leaving the topic for special education. This dissertation serves not only to shed light on a blind spot of the separation between general VS. special education paradigm, but also to draw holistic attention of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, curriculum developers, and others towards the need for inclusive STEM learning ecology where sighted and blind learners are all taken into account under the fundamental question of How People Learn. Secondly, the research suggested a novel methodology to investigate large corpora of texts in rigorous, reliable, and reproducible ways. Drawing upon analytical procedure of the five phases of Knowledge Discovery in Textual Databases [KDT; Feldman &amp; Dagan (1995)] combined with the three-step Computational Grounded Theory (Nelson, 2017), this study detailed each phase of the proposed investigative phenomenon, which is often an underexplored approach in traditional qualitative research, to offer the readers reproducible trustworthiness across the study holistically. Finally, this dissertation described how a blind learning scientist researches. Unlike either special education or social welfare fields, finding a researcher who is blind is quite rare. Moreover, little is known about the challenges and solutions of a blind person from a researchers perspective going beyond study subjects. I, as a lifelong blind person myself, self-reported on how I researched from data collection to analysis throughout this study to inspire other sighted and blind learning scientists to look into non-visual techniques in the field where video-based interaction analysis is dominant. 5.4 Suggestions for Future Research Although this study has attempted to respond the paucity of STEM learning accessibility for blind people, there are few areas that require further attention for future research. First, supervised and semi-supervised algorithms should be considered. The computational algorithms that I implemented was based soely on unsupervised machine learning. Although it was an appropriate choice given that there was no label information corresponding to each document, recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms, such as long short-term memory ((LSTM) could have been utilized to deeply investigate linguistic sequential patterns out of the NFB corpus. Future research needs to expand the current topic modeling results as deductive labels to build more rigorous knowledge detection models. Second, other network analysis should be collectively applied to the hybrid mixed-methods coding results. I only implemented networks for linguistic pattern detections (Chapter 4.2.2); however, epistemic network analysis (ENA, David W. Shaffer, 2006) could be also employed to capture how community members epistemic concepts are interrelated over time across different listservs. Finally, the num_discussants variable that contains the number of participants per message can be used for guiding more weighted models or hybrid coding results. For the sake of simplicity, I did not factor in this variable as a covariate when fitting the structural topic models. As each message document has different level of participation within corpus, it is advisable for future researchers to consider the weighted effect to capture more pronounced results. This is, to my knowledge, the first study using the largest corpus where blind individuals describe their stories, challenges, and solutions for STEM learning experiences in their own words at a community level (National Federation of the Blind, n.d.) that has not been fabricated by any third-party researcher(s). I have high hopes that my dissertation study could initiate meaningful scholarly and practical discussions on how to better foster a more inclusive, accessible, and equitable STEM education in which sighted and blind students enjoy the ecological value of STEM. 5.5 Acknowledgements I would like to thank the National Federation of the Blind and the members who generously shared their collective wisdom, experience, and materials for the purposes of this research.
